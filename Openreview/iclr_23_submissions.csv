Guiding Safe Exploration with Weakest Preconditions,"In reinforcement learning for safety-critical settings, it is often desirable for the agent to obey safety constraints at all points in time, including during training. We present a novel neurosymbolic approach called SPICE to solve this safe exploration problem. SPICE uses an online shielding layer based on symbolic weakest preconditions to achieve a more precise safety analysis than existing tools without unduly impacting the training process. We evaluate the approach on a suite of continuous control benchmarks and show that it can achieve comparable performance to existing safe learning techniques while incurring fewer safety violations. Additionally, we present theoretical results showing that SPICE converges to the optimal safe policy under reasonable assumptions.",1
An Adaptive Entropy-Regularization Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we propose an adaptive entropy-regularization framework (ADER) for multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the adequate amount of exploration for each agent based on the degree of required exploration. In order to handle instability arising from updating multiple entropy temperature parameters for multiple agents, we disentangle the soft value function into two types: one for pure reward and the other for entropy. By applying multi-agent value factorization to the disentangled value function of pure reward, we obtain a relevant metric to assess the necessary degree of exploration for each agent. Based on this metric, we propose the ADER algorithm based on maximum entropy RL, which controls the necessary level of exploration across agents over time by learning the proper target entropy for each agent. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art multi-agent RL algorithms. ",0
AutoSparse: Towards Automated Sparse Training,"Sparse training is emerging as a promising avenue for reducing the computational cost of training neural networks. Several recent studies have proposed pruning methods using learnable thresholds to efficiently explore the non-uniform distribution of sparsity inherent within the models. In this paper, we propose Gradient Annealing (GA), a gradient driven approach where gradients to pruned out weights are scaled down in a non-linear manner. GA eliminates the need for additional sparsity-inducing regularization by providing an elegant trade-off between sparsity and accuracy. We integrated GA with the latest learnable threshold based pruning methods to create an automated sparse training algorithm called AutoSparse. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 80% sparsity for ResNet50 and 75% sparsity for  MobileNetV1 on Imagenet-1K. AutoSparse also results in 7× reduction in inference FLOPS and > 2× reduction in training FLOPS for ResNet50 on ImageNet at 80% sparsity. Finally, GA generalizes well to fixed-budget (Top-K, 80%) sparse training methods, improving the accuracy of ResNet50 on Imagenet-1K, to outperform TopKAST+PP by 0.3%.",0
Sampling is as easy as learning the score: theory for diffusion models with minimal data assumptions,"We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for score-based generative models (SGMs) such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), which constitute the backbone of large-scale real-world generative models such as DALL$\cdot$E 2. Our main result is that, assuming accurate score estimates, such SGMs can efficiently sample from essentially any realistic data distribution. In contrast to prior works, our results (1) hold for an $L^2$-accurate score estimate (rather than $L^\infty$-accurate); (2) do not require restrictive functional inequality conditions that preclude substantial non-log-concavity; (3) scale polynomially in all relevant problem parameters; and (4) match state-of-the-art complexity guarantees for discretization of the Langevin diffusion, provided that the score error is sufficiently small. We view this as strong theoretical justification for the empirical success of SGMs. We also examine SGMs based on the critically damped Langevin diffusion (CLD). Contrary to conventional wisdom, we provide evidence that the use of the CLD does *not* reduce the complexity of SGMs.",1
RoCourseNet: Distributionally Robust Training of a Prediction Aware Recourse Model,"Counterfactual (CF) explanations for machine learning (ML) models are preferred by end-users, as they explain the predictions of ML models by providing a recourse (or contrastive) case to individuals who are adversely impacted by predicted outcomes. Existing CF explanation methods generate recourses under the assumption that the underlying target ML model remains stationary over time. However, due to commonly occurring distributional shifts in training data, ML models constantly get updated in practice, which might render previously generated recourses invalid and diminish end-users trust in our algorithmic framework. To address this problem, we propose RoCourseNet, a training framework that jointly optimizes for predictions and recourses that are robust to future data shifts. We have three main contributions: (i) We propose a novel \emph{virtual data shift (VDS)} algorithm to find worst-case shifted ML models by explicitly considering the worst-case data shift in the training dataset. (ii) We leverage adversarial training to solve a novel tri-level optimization problem inside RoCourseNet, which simultaneously generates predictions and corresponding robust recourses. (iii) Finally, we evaluate RoCourseNet's performance on three real-world datasets and show that RoCourseNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $\sim$10\% in generating robust CF explanations.

Irregularity Reflection Neural Network for Time Series Forecasting,"Time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in a variety of industries, and deep learning stands as the mainstream paradigm for handling this forecasting problem. With recent success, representations of time series components (e.g., trend and seasonality) are also considered in the learning process of the models. However, the residual remains under explored due to difficulty in formulating its inherent complexity. In this study, we propose a novel Irregularity Reflection Neural Network (IRN) that reflect the residual for the time series forecasting. First, we redefine the residual as the irregularity and express it as a sum of individual, short regular waves considering the Fourier series in a micro perspective. Second, we design a module, based on the convolutional architectures to mimic the variables of the derived irregularity representation, named Irregularity Representation Block (IRB). IRN comprises IRB on top of a forecasting model to learn the irregularity representation of time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that IRN outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in time series forecasting tasks. ",0
Sample-efficient multi-objective molecular optimization with GFlowNets,"Many crucial scientific problems involve designing novel molecules with desired properties, which can be formulated as an expensive black-box optimization problem over the discrete chemical space. Computational methods have achieved initial success but still struggle with simultaneously optimizing multiple competing properties in a sample-efficient manner. In this work, we propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm leveraging the hypernetwork-based GFlowNets (HN-GFN) as an acquisition function optimizer, with the purpose of sampling a diverse batch of candidate molecular graphs from an approximate Pareto front. Using a single preference-conditioned hypernetwork, HN-GFN learns to explore various trade-offs between objectives. Inspired by reinforcement learning, we further propose a hindsight-like off-policy strategy to share high-performing molecules among different preferences in order to speed up learning for HN-GFN. Through synthetic experiments, we illustrate that HN-GFN has adequate capacity to generalize over preferences. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms the best baselines by a large margin in terms of hypervolume in various real-world MOBO settings.",0
MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting,"Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.",1
PLOT: Prompt Learning with Optimal Transport for Vision-Language Models,"With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP, there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/CHENGY12/PLOT.",1
Improved Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Energy-Based Priors: a Study on Electrical Impedance Tomography,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are attracting significant attention for solving partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problems, including electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is non-linear and especially its inverse problem is highly ill-posed. Therefore, successful training of PINN is extremely sensitive to interplay between different loss terms and hyper-parameters, including the learning rate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian approach through data-driven energy-based model (EBM) as a prior, to improve the overall accuracy and quality of tomographic reconstruction. In particular, the EBM is trained over the possible solutions of the PDEs with different boundary conditions. By imparting such prior onto physics-based training, PINN convergence is expedited by more than ten times faster to the PDE’s solution. Evaluation outcome shows that our proposed method is more robust for solving the EIT problem. Our code is available at: https://rooshenasgroup.github.io/eit_ebprior.",1
Energy-based Out-of-Distribution Detection for Graph Neural Networks,"Representation learning on semi-structured data, e.g., graphs, has become a central problem in deep learning community as relational structures are pervasive in real situations and induce data inter-dependence that hinders trivial adaptation of existing approaches in other domains where the inputs are assumed to be i.i.d. sampled. However, current models in this regime mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data and largely ignores the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing samples that may cause negative outcome if the model is overconfident in prediction on them. In this paper, we identify a provably effective OOD discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from a graph neural network trained with standard supervised classification loss. This paves a way for a simple and efficient OOD detection model for GNN-based semi-supervised learning on graphs, which we call GNN-Safe. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for in-distribution and OOD samples, which, more critically, can be further strengthened by a non-learning-based structured propagation scheme. Extensive experiments over five real-world datasets validate the practical efficacy of the proposed model for detecting various OOD instances that are inter-connected in a graph with up to 17.0% improvement on average AUROC over competitive peer models and without sacrificing in-distribution testing accuracy.",1
Differentially private Bias-Term Only Fine-tuning of Foundation Models,"We study the problem of differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of large pre-trained models — a recent privacy-preserving approach suitable for solving downstream tasks with sensitive data. Existing work has demonstrated that high accuracy is possible under strong privacy constraint, yet requires significant computational overhead or modifications to the network architecture.

We propose differentially private bias-term fine-tuning (DP-BiTFiT), which matches the state-of-the-art accuracy for DP algorithms and the efficiency of the standard BiTFiT. DP-BiTFiT is model agnostic (not modifying the network architecture), parameter efficient (only training about $0.1\%$ of the parameters), and computation efficient (almost removing the overhead caused by DP, in both the time and space complexity). On a wide range of tasks, DP-BiTFiT is $2\sim 30\times$ faster and uses $2\sim 8\times$ less memory than DP full fine-tuning, even faster than the standard full fine-tuning. This amazing efficiency enables us to conduct DP fine-tuning on language and vision tasks with long-sequence texts and high-resolution images, which were computationally difficult using existing methods.",0
"More Centralized Training, Still Decentralized Execution: Multi-Agent Conditional Policy Factorization","In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), combining value decomposition with actor-critic enables agents to learn stochastic policies, which are more suitable for the partially observable environment. Given the goal of learning local policies that enable decentralized execution, agents are commonly assumed to be independent of each other, even in centralized training. However, such an assumption may prohibit agents from learning the optimal joint policy. To address this problem, we explicitly take the dependency among agents into centralized training. Although this leads to the optimal joint policy, it may not be factorized for decentralized execution. Nevertheless, we theoretically show that from such a joint policy, we can always derive another joint policy that achieves the same optimality but can be factorized for decentralized execution. To this end, we propose multi-agent conditional policy factorization (MACPF), which takes more centralized training but still enables decentralized execution. We empirically verify MACPF in various cooperative MARL tasks and demonstrate that MACPF achieves better performance or faster convergence than baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/FOP-DMAC-MACPF.",1
Hierarchical Relational Learning for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine the meta representation of few-shot relations, and consequently generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code of HiRe can be found in supplementary material and will be released after acceptance.",1
Error Sensitivity Modulation based Experience Replay: Mitigating Abrupt Representation Drift in Continual Learning,"Humans excel at lifelong learning, as the brain has evolved to be robust to distribution shifts and noise in our ever-changing environment. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose ""ESMER"" which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We also propose ""Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling"" to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data streams.",1
Deep Generative Wasserstein Gradient Flows,"Deep generative modeling is a rapidly-advancing field with a wealth of modeling choices developed in the past decades. Amongst them, Wasserstein gradient flows (WGF) are a powerful and theoretically rich class of methods.
However, their applications to high-dimensional distributions remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present Deep Generative Wasserstein Gradient Flows (DGGF), which constructs a WGF between two distributions by minimizing the entropy-regularized $f$-divergence. We demonstrate how to train a deep density ratio estimator that is required for the WGF and apply it to the task of generative modeling. Experiments demonstrate that DGGF is able to synthesize high-fidelity images of resolutions up to $128\times128$, directly in data space. We demonstrate that DGGF has an interpretable diagnostic of sample quality by naturally estimating the KL divergence throughout the gradient flow. Finally, we show DGGF's modularity by composition with external density ratio estimators for conditional generation, as well as for unpaired image-to-image translation with no modifications to the framework.",0
Adaptive Optimization in the $\infty$-Width Limit,"Recent works have developed detailed understanding of large neural networks' behaviors via their infinite-width limits, e.g., the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and the feature learning ($\mu$) limits. These theories were developed for stochastic gradient descent. Yet, in practice, all large NN are trained using Adam or other adaptive gradient optimizers (AGO), which are not covered by such previous works. Here, we close this gap via the Tensor Programs framework. Specifically, for deep MLPs, we derive the NTK and $\mu$ parametrizations as well as their infinite-width limits. We find 1) The NTK limit of AGO, in contrast to that of SGD, now depends nonlinearly on the loss derivative but nevertheless still fails to learn features; 2) this is fixed by the $\mu$ limit of AGO (as in the case of SGD). To obtain these results, we extend the Tensor Programs language with a new instruction that allows one to express the gradient processing done by AGOs.",1
Amos: An Adam-style Optimizer with Adaptive Weight Decay towards Model-Oriented Scale,"We present Amos, a stochastic gradient-based optimizer designed for training deep neural networks. It can be viewed as an Adam optimizer with theoretically supported, adaptive learning-rate decay and weight decay. A key insight behind Amos is that it leverages model-specific information to determine the initial learning-rate and decaying schedules. When used for pre-training BERT variants and T5, Amos consistently converges faster than the state-of-the-art settings of AdamW, achieving better validation loss within <=70% training steps and time, while requiring <=51% memory for slot variables.",0
SciRepEval: A Multi-Format Benchmark for Scientific Document Representations,"Learned representations of scientific documents can serve as valuable input features for downstream tasks, without the need for further fine-tuning. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating these representations fail to capture the diversity of relevant tasks. In response, we introduce SciRepEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating scientific document representations. It includes 25 challenging and realistic tasks across four formats: classification, regression, ranking and search. We then use the benchmark to study and improve the generalization ability of scientific document representation models.  We show how state-of-the-art models struggle to generalize across task formats, and that simple multi-task training fails to improve them.  However, a new approach that learns multiple embeddings per document, each tailored to a different task format, can improve performance.
We experiment with task-format-specific control codes and adapters in a multi-task setting and find that they outperform the existing single-embedding state-of-the-art by up to 1.5 points absolute. ",0
On Pre-training Language Model for Antibody,"Antibodies are vital proteins offering robust protection for the human body from pathogens. The development of general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models both facilitate antibody prediction tasks. However, there have been limited studies that comprehensively explore the representation capability of distinct pre-trained language models on different antibody tasks. To investigate the problem, we aim to answer several key questions in this paper, such as how pre-trained language models perform in antibody tasks with different specificity and how introducing specific biological mechanisms to the pre-training process can benefit the model. Additionally, we evaluate if the learned antibody pre-trained representations can be applied to real-world antibody problems, like drug discovery and immune process understanding. Previously, no benchmark available largely hindered the study to answer these questions. To aid in our investigation, we provide an AnTibody Understanding Evaluation (ATUE) benchmark. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of protein pre-trained language models by empirical study along with conclusions and new insights. Our ATUE and code are released at https://github.com/dqwang122/EATLM.",1
MetaFS: An Effective Wrapper Feature Selection via Meta Learning,"Feature selection is of great importance and applies in lots of fields, such as medical and commercial. Wrapper methods, directly comparing the performance of different feature combinations, are widely used in real-world applications. However, selecting effective features meets the following two main challenges: 1) feature combinations are distributed in a huge discrete space; and 2) efficient and precise combinations evaluation is hard. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel deep meta-learning-based feature selection framework, termed MetaFS, containing a Feature Subset Sampler (FSS) and a Meta Feature Estimator (MetaFE), which transforms the discrete search space into continuous and adopts meta-learning technique for effective feature selection. Specifically, FSS parameterizes the distribution of discrete search space and applies gradient-based methods to optimize. MetaFE learns the representations of different feature combinations, and dynamically generates unique models without retraining for efficient and precise combination evaluation. We adopt a bi-level optimization strategy to optimize the MetaFS. After optimization, we evaluate multiple feature combinations sampled from the converged distribution (i.e., the condensed search space) and select the optimal one. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, illustrating the superiority of MetaFS over 7 state-of-the-art methods.",0
Achieving Sub-linear Regret in Infinite Horizon Average Reward Constrained MDP with Linear Function Approximation,"We study the infinite horizon average reward constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). In contrast to existing works on model-based, finite state space, we consider the model-free linear CMDP setup.  We first propose a computationally inefficient algorithm and show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3T})$ regret and constraint violation can be achieved, in which $T$ is the number of interactions, and $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. We also propose an efficient variant based on the primal-dual adaptation of the LSVI-UCB algorithm and show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((dT)^{3/4})$ regret and constraint violation can be achieved. 
This improves the known regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{5/6})$ for the finite state-space model-free constrained RL which was obtained under a stronger assumption compared to ours.  We also develop an efficient policy-based algorithm via novel adaptation of the MDP-EXP2 algorithm to our primal-dual set up with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and even zero constraint violation bound under a stronger set of assumptions.",1
BO-Muse: A Human expert and AI teaming framework for accelerated experimental design ,"In this paper we introduce BO-Muse, a new approach to human-AI teaming for the optimisation of expensive blackbox functions. Inspired by the intrinsic difficulty of extracting expert knowledge and distilling it back into AI models and by observations of human behaviour in real-world experimental design, our algorithm lets the human expert take the lead in the experimental process. The human expert can use their domain expertise to its full potential, while the AI plays the role of a muse, injecting novelty and searching for areas of weakness to break the human out of over-exploitation induced by cognitive entrenchment. With mild assumptions, we show that our algorithm converges sub-linearly, at a rate faster than the AI or human alone. We validate our algorithm using synthetic data and with human experts performing real-world experiments.",0
Integrating Episodic and Global Novelty Bonuses for Efficient Exploration,"Exploration in environments which differ across episodes has received increasing attention in recent years. Current methods use some combination of global novelty bonuses, computed using the agent's entire training experience, and episodic novelty bonuses, computed using only experience from the current episode. However, the use of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc and poorly understood. In this work, we first shed light on the behavior these two kinds of bonuses on hard exploration tasks through easily interpretable examples. We find that the two types of bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most effective when there is little shared structure between environments and global bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We also find that combining the two bonuses leads to more robust behavior across both of these settings. Motivated by these findings, we then investigate different algorithmic choices for defining and combining function approximation-based global and episodic bonuses. This results in a new algorithm which sets a new state of the art across 18 tasks from the MiniHack suite used in prior work. Our code is public at \url{web-link}. ",0
oViT: An Accurate Second-Order Pruning Framework for Vision Transformers,"Models from the Vision Transformer (ViT) family have recently provided breakthrough results across image classification tasks such as ImageNet. Yet, they still face barriers to deployment, notably the fact that their accuracy can be severely impacted by compression techniques such as pruning. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by introducing \textit{Optimal ViT Surgeon (oViT)}, a new state-of-the-art method for the weight sparsification of Vision Transformers (ViT) models. At the technical level, oViT introduces a new weight pruning algorithm which leverages second-order information, specifically adapted to be both highly-accurate and efficient in the context of ViTs. We complement this accurate one-shot pruner with an in-depth investigation of gradual pruning, augmentation, and recovery schedules for ViTs, which we show to be critical for successful ViT compression. We validate our method via extensive experiments on classical ViT and DeiT models, as well as on newer variants, such as XCiT, EfficientFormer and Swin. Moreover, our results are even relevant to recently-proposed highly-accurate ResNets. Our results show for the first time that ViT-family models can in fact be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\geq 75\%$) with low impact on accuracy ($\leq 1\%$ relative drop), and that our approach outperforms prior methods by significant margins at high sparsities. In addition, we show that our method is compatible with structured pruning methods and quantization, and that it can lead to significant speedups on a sparsity-aware inference engine.

Sampling with Mollified Interaction Energy Descent,"Sampling from a target measure whose density is only known up to a normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions---smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives.

Soundness and Completeness: An Algorithmic Perspective on Evaluation of Feature Attribution,"Feature attribution is a fundamental approach to explaining neural networks by quantifying the importance of input features for a model's prediction. Although a variety of feature attribution methods have been proposed, there is little consensus on the assessment of attribution methods. In this study, we empirically show the limitations of \emph{order-based} and \emph{model-retraining} metrics. To overcome the limitations and enable evaluation with higher granularity, we propose a novel method to evaluate the \emph{completeness} and \emph{soundness} of feature attribution methods. Our proposed evaluation metrics are mathematically grounded on algorithm theory and require no knowledge of ""ground truth"" informative features. We validate our proposed metrics by conducting experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Lastly, we use the proposed metrics to benchmark a wide range of feature attribution methods. Our evaluation results provide an innovative perspective on comparing feature attribution methods. Code is in the supplementary material. ",0
Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation MaskCLIP,"In this paper, we tackle an emerging computer vision task, open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation, that aims to perform panoptic segmentation (background semantic labeling + foreground instance segmentation) for arbitrary categories of text-based descriptions in inference time. We first build a baseline method by directly adopting pre-trained CLIP models without finetuning nor distillation. We then develop MaskCLIP, a Transformer-based approach with a Relative Mask Attention (RMA) module. The RMA is an encoder-only module that seamless integrates mask tokens with a pre-trained ViT CLIP model for semantic/instance segmentation and class prediction. MaskCLIP learns to efficiently and effectively utilize pre-trained dense/local CLIP features within the RMA that avoids the time-consuming student-teacher training process. We obtain encouraging results for open-vocabulary panoptic/instance segmentation and state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation on ADE20K and PASCAL datasets. We show qualitative illustration for MaskCLIP with online custom categories.",0
FIFA: Making Fairness More Generalizable in Classifiers Trained on Imbalanced Data,"Algorithmic fairness plays an important role in machine learning and imposing fairness constraints during learning is a common approach. However, many datasets are imbalanced in certain label classes (e.g. ""healthy"") and sensitive subgroups (e.g. ""older patients""). Empirically, this imbalance leads to a lack of generalizability not only of classification but also of fairness properties, especially in over-parameterized models. For example, fairness-aware training may 
ensure equalized odds (EO) on the training data, but EO is far from being satisfied on new users. In this paper, we propose a theoretically-principled, yet {\bf F}lexible approach that is {\bf I}mbalance-{\bf F}airness-{\bf A}ware ({\bf FIFA}). Specifically, FIFA encourages both classification and fairness generalization and can be flexibly combined with many existing fair learning methods with logits-based losses. While our main focus is on EO, FIFA can be directly applied to achieve equalized opportunity (EqOpt); and under certain conditions, it can also be applied to other fairness notions. We demonstrate the power of FIFA by combining it with a popular fair classification algorithm, and the resulting algorithm achieves significantly better fairness generalization on several real-world datasets.",1
Spatiotemporal Modeling of Multivariate Signals with Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models,"Multivariate signals are prevalent in various domains, such as healthcare, transportation systems, and space sciences. Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate signals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between sensors. To address these challenges, we propose representing multivariate signals as graphs and introduce GraphS4mer, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in multivariate signals. Specifically, (1) we leverage Structured State Spaces model (S4), a state-of-the-art sequence model, to capture long-term temporal dependencies and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in GraphS4mer to automatically learn the underlying graph structures in the data.  We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct tasks and show that GraphS4mer consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalography signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pretraining by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnography signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) traffic forecasting, reducing MAE by 8.8% compared to existing GNNs and by 1.4% compared to transformer-based models.",0
Comfort Zone: A Vicinal Distribution for Regression Problems,"Domain-dependent data augmentation methods generate artificial samples using transformations suited for the underlying data domain, for example rotations on images and time warping on time series data. However, domain-independent approaches, e.g. mixup, are applicable to various data modalities, and as such they are general and versatile. While mixup-based techniques are used extensively in classification problems, their effect on regression tasks is somewhat less explored. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of domain-independent augmentation for regression, and we introduce comfort-zone: a new data-driven, domain-independent data augmentation method. Essentially, our approach samples new examples from the tangent planes of the train distribution. Augmenting data in this way aligns with the network tendency towards capturing the dominant features of its input signals. Evaluating comfort-zone on regression and time series forecasting benchmarks, we show that it improves the generalization of several neural architectures. We also find that mixup and noise injection are less effective in comparison to comfort-zone.",0
Adversarial Counterfactual Environment Model Learning,"A good model for action-effect prediction, i.e., the environment model, is essential for sample-efficient policy learning, in which the agent can take numerous free trials to find good policies. Currently, the model is commonly learned by fitting historical transition data through empirical risk minimization (ERM). However, we discover that simple data fitting can lead to a model that will be totally wrong in guiding policy learning due to the selection bias in offline dataset collection. In this work, we introduce weighted empirical risk minimization (WERM) to handle this problem in model learning.  A typical WERM method utilizes inverse propensity scores to re-weight the training data to approximate the target distribution. However, during the policy training, the data distributions of the candidate policies can be various and unknown. Thus, we propose an adversarial weighted empirical risk minimization (AWRM) objective that learns the model with respect to the worst case of the target distributions. We implement AWRM in a sequential decision structure, resulting in the GALILEO model learning algorithm. We also discover that GALILEO is closely related to adversarial model learning, explaining the empirical effectiveness of the latter. We apply GALILEO in synthetic tasks and verify that GALILEO makes accurate predictions on counterfactual data. We finally applied GALILEO in real-world offline policy learning tasks and found that GALILEO significantly improves policy performance in real-world testing.",0
PD-MORL: Preference-Driven Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Algorithm,"Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) approaches have emerged to tackle many real-world problems with multiple conflicting objectives by maximizing a joint objective function weighted by a preference vector. These approaches find fixed customized policies corresponding to preference vectors specified during training. However, the design constraints and objectives typically change dynamically in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, storing a policy for each potential preference is not scalable. Hence, obtaining a set of Pareto front solutions for the entire preference space in a given domain with a single training is critical. To this end, we propose a novel MORL algorithm that trains a single universal network to cover the entire preference space scalable to continuous robotic tasks. The proposed approach, Preference-Driven MORL (PD-MORL), utilizes the preferences as guidance to update the network parameters. It also employs a novel parallelization approach to increase sample efficiency. We show that PD-MORL achieves up to 25% larger hypervolume for challenging continuous control tasks and uses an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters compared to prior approaches.",1
CircNet: Meshing 3D Point Clouds with Circumcenter Detection,"Reconstructing 3D point clouds into triangle meshes is a key problem in computational geometry and surface reconstruction. Point cloud triangulation solves this problem by providing edge information to the input points. Since no vertex interpolation is involved, it is beneficial to preserve sharp details on the surface. Taking advantage of learning-based techniques in triangulation, existing methods enumerate the complete combinations of candidate triangles, which is both complex and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage the duality between a triangle and its circumcenter, and introduce a deep neural network that detects the circumcenters to achieve point cloud triangulation. Specifically, we introduce multiple anchor priors to divide the neighborhood space of each point. The neural network then learns to predict the presences and locations of circumcenters under the guidance of those anchors. We extract the triangles dual to the detected circumcenters to form a primitive mesh, from which an edge-manifold mesh is produced via simple post-processing. Unlike existing learning-based triangulation methods, the proposed method bypasses an exhaustive enumeration of triangle combinations and local surface parameterization. We validate the efficiency, generalization, and robustness of our method on prominent datasets of both watertight and open surfaces. The code and trained models are provided at \url{https://github.com/Ruitao-L/CircNet}.",1
Semi-supervised learning with a principled likelihood from a generative model of data curation,"We currently do not have an understanding of semi-supervised learning (SSL) objectives such as pseudo-labelling and entropy minimization as log-likelihoods, which precludes the development of e.g. Bayesian SSL. Here, we note that benchmark image datasets such as CIFAR-10 are carefully curated, and we formulate SSL objectives as a log-likelihood in a generative model of data curation. We show that SSL objectives, from entropy minimization and pseudo-labelling, to state-of-the-art techniques similar to FixMatch can be understood as lower-bounds on our principled log-likelihood. We are thus able to introduce a Bayesian extension of SSL, which gives considerable improvements over standard SSL in the setting of 40 labelled points on CIFAR-10, with performance of $92.2\pm 0.3\%$ vs $88.6\%$ in the original FixMatch paper. Finally, our theory suggests that SSL is effective in part due to the statistical patterns induced by data curation. This provides an explanation of past results which show SSL performs better on clean datasets without any ``out of distribution'' examples. Confirming these results we find that SSL gave much larger performance improvements on curated than on uncurated data, using matched curated and uncurated datasets based on Galaxy Zoo 2.",1
Q-Match: Self-Supervised Learning For Tabular Data by Matching Distributions Induced by a Queue,"In semi-supervised learning, student-teacher distribution matching has been successful in improving performance of models using unlabeled data in conjunction with few labeled samples. In this paper, we aim to replicate that success in the self-supervised setup where we do not have access to any labeled data during pre-training. We show it is possible to induce the student-teacher distributions without any knowledge of downstream classes by using a queue of embeddings of samples from the unlabeled dataset. We show that Q-Match outperforms previous self-supervised learning techniques on tabular datasets when measuring downstream classification performance. Furthermore, we show that our method is sample efficient, both in terms of labels required for both downstream task training and amount of unlabeled data required for pre-training.",0
REPRESENTATIVE PROTOTYPE WITH CONSTRASTIVE LEARNING FOR SEMI-SUPENVISED FEW-SHOT CLASSIFICATION,"Few-shot learning aims to learn novel classes in the dataset with few samples per class, which is a very challenging task. To mitigate this issue, the prior work obtain representative prototypes with semantic embeddin based on prototypical networks. While the above methods do not meet the requirement of few-shot learning, which requires abundant labeled samples. Therefore, We propose a new model framework to get representative prototypes with semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduces the dataset containing unlabeled samples to assist training the model. More importantly, to fully utilize these unlabeled samples, we adopt conditional variational autoencoder to construct more representative prototypes. Simultaneously, we develop novel contrastive loss to improve the model generalization ability. We evaluate our method on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks for both 1-shot and 5-shot settings and achieve better performance over the state-of-the-art semisupervised few-shot method.",0
Is Adversarial Training Really a Silver Bullet for Mitigating Data Poisoning?,"Indiscriminate data poisoning can decrease the clean test accuracy of a deep learning model by slightly perturbing its training samples.
There is a consensus that such poisons can hardly harm adversarially-trained (AT) models when the adversarial training budget is no less than the poison budget, i.e., $\epsilon_\mathrm{adv}\geq\epsilon_\mathrm{poi}$. This consensus, however, is challenged in this paper based on our new attack strategy that induces \textit{entangled features} (EntF). The existence of entangled features makes the poisoned data become less useful for training a model, no matter if AT is applied or not. We demonstrate that for attacking a CIFAR-10 AT model under a reasonable setting with $\epsilon_\mathrm{adv}=\epsilon_\mathrm{poi}=8/255$, our EntF yields an accuracy drop of $13.31\%$, which is $7\times$ better than existing methods and equal to discarding $83\%$ training data. We further show the generalizability of EntF to more challenging settings, e.g., higher AT budgets, partial poisoning, unseen model architectures, and stronger (ensemble or adaptive) defenses. We finally provide new insights into the distinct roles of non-robust vs. robust features in poisoning standard vs. AT models and demonstrate the possibility of using a hybrid attack to poison standard and AT models simultaneously. Our code is available at~\url{https://github.com/WenRuiUSTC/EntF}.",1
Progressive Voronoi Diagram Subdivision Enables Accurate Data-free Class-Incremental Learning,"Data-free Class-incremental Learning (CIL) is a challenging problem because rehearsing data from previous phases is strictly prohibited, causing catastrophic forgetting of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we present \emph{iVoro}, a novel framework derived from computational geometry. We found Voronoi Diagram (VD), a classical model for space subdivision, is especially powerful for solving the CIL problem, because VD itself can be constructed favorably in an incremental manner -- the newly added sites (classes) will only affect the proximate classes, making the non-contiguous classes hardly forgettable. Furthermore, we bridge DNN and VD using Power Diagram Reduction, and show that the VD structure can be progressively refined along the phases using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Moreover, our VD construction is not restricted to the deep feature space, but is also applicable to multiple intermediate feature spaces, promoting VD to be multilayer VD that efficiently captures multi-grained features from DNN. Importantly, \emph{iVoro} is also capable of handling uncertainty-aware test-time Voronoi cell assignment and has exhibited high correlations between geometric uncertainty and predictive accuracy (up to ${\sim}0.9$). Putting everything together, \emph{iVoro} achieves up to $25.26\%$, $37.09\%$, and $33.21\%$ improvements on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art non-exemplar CIL approaches. In conclusion, \emph{iVoro} enables highly accurate, privacy-preserving, and geometrically interpretable CIL that is particularly useful when cross-phase data sharing is forbidden, e.g. in medical applications.",1
Differentiable Rendering with Reparameterized Volume Sampling,"We propose an alternative rendering algorithm for neural radiance fields based on importance sampling. In view synthesis, a neural radiance field approximates underlying density and radiance fields based on a sparse set of views of a scene. To generate a pixel of a novel view, it marches a ray through the pixel and computes a weighted sum of radiance emitted from a dense set of ray points. This rendering algorithm is fully differentiable and facilitates gradient-based optimization of the fields. However, in practice, only a tiny opaque portion of the ray contributes most of the radiance to the sum. Therefore, we can avoid computing radiance in the rest part. In this work, we use importance sampling to pick non-transparent points on the ray. Specifically, we generate samples according to the probability distribution induced by the density field. Our main contribution is the reparameterization of the sampling algorithm. It allows end-to-end learning with gradient descent as in the original rendering algorithm. With our approach, we can optimize a neural radiance field with just a few radiance field evaluations per ray. As a result, we alleviate the costs associated with the color component of the neural radiance field.",0
Feature Reconstruction From Outputs Can Mitigate Simplicity Bias in Neural Networks,"Deep Neural Networks are known to be brittle to even minor distribution shifts compared to the training distribution. While one line of work has demonstrated that \emph{Simplicity Bias} (SB) of DNNs -- bias towards learning only the simplest features -- is a key reason for this brittleness, another recent line of work has surprisingly found that diverse/ complex features are indeed learned by the backbone, and their brittleness is due to the linear classification head relying primarily on the simplest features. To bridge the gap between these two lines of work, we first hypothesize and verify that while SB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler features over complex ones. Namely, simple features are replicated several times in the learned representations while complex features might not be replicated. This phenomenon, we term \emph{Feature  Replication  Hypothesis}, coupled with the \emph{Implicit Bias} of SGD to converge to maximum margin solutions in the feature space, leads the models to rely mostly on the simple features for classification. To mitigate this bias, we propose \emph{Feature Reconstruction Regularizer (FRR)} to ensure that the learned features can be reconstructed back from the logits. The use of \emph{FRR} in linear layer training (\emph{FRR-L}) encourages the use of more diverse features for classification. We further propose to finetune the full network by freezing the weights of the linear layer trained using \emph{FRR-L}, to refine the learned features, making them more suitable for classification. Using this simple solution, we demonstrate up to 15\% gains in OOD accuracy on the recently introduced semi-synthetic datasets with extreme distribution shifts. Moreover, we demonstrate noteworthy gains over existing SOTA methods on the standard OOD benchmark DomainBed as well.",1
Private Data Stream Analysis for Universal Symmetric Norm Estimation,"We study how to release summary statistics on a data stream subject to the constraint of differential privacy. In particular, we focus on releasing the family of \emph{symmetric norms}, which are invariant under sign-flips and coordinate-wise permutations on an input data stream and include $L_p$ norms, $k$-support norms, top-$k$ norms, and the box norm as special cases. Although it may be possible to design and analyze a separate mechanism for each symmetric norm, we propose a general parametrizable framework that differentially privately releases a number of sufficient statistics from which the approximation of all symmetric norms can be simultaneously computed. Our framework partitions the coordinates of the underlying frequency vector into different levels based on their magnitude and releases approximate frequencies for the ``heavy'' coordinates in important levels and releases approximate level sizes for the ``light'' coordinates in important levels.  Surprisingly, our mechanism allows for the release of an \emph{arbitrary} number of symmetric norm approximations without any overhead or additional loss in privacy. Moreover, our mechanism permits $(1+\alpha)$-approximation to each of the symmetric norms and can be implemented using sublinear space in the streaming model for many regimes of the accuracy and privacy parameters.",0
Minimax Optimal Kernel Operator Learning via Multilevel Training,"Learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces have achieved empirical success in many disciplines of machine learning, including generative modeling, functional data analysis, causal inference, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this paper, we study the statistical limit of learning a Hilbert-Schmidt operator between two infinite-dimensional Sobolev reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We establish the information-theoretic lower bound in terms of the Sobolev Hilbert-Schmidt norm and show that a regularization that learns the spectral components below the bias contour and ignores the ones above the variance contour can achieve the optimal learning rate. At the same time, the spectral components between the bias and variance contours give us flexibility in designing computationally feasible machine learning algorithms. Based on this observation, we develop a multilevel kernel operator learning algorithm that is optimal when learning linear operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces.",1
Denoising Masked Autoencoders Help Robust Classification,"In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised method, which is called denoising masked autoencoders (DMAE), for learning certified robust classifiers of images. In DMAE, we corrupt each image by adding Gaussian noises to each pixel value and randomly masking several patches. A Transformer-based encoder-decoder model is then trained to reconstruct the original image from the corrupted one. In this learning paradigm, the encoder will learn to capture relevant semantics for the downstream tasks, which is also robust to Gaussian additive noises. We show that the pre-trained encoder can naturally be used as the base classifier in Gaussian smoothed models, where we can analytically compute the certified radius for any data point. Although the proposed method is simple, it yields significant performance improvement in downstream classification tasks. We show that the DMAE ViT-Base model, which just uses 1/10 parameters of the model developed in recent work (Carlini et al., 2022), achieves competitive or better certified accuracy in various settings. The DMAE ViT-Large model significantly surpasses all previous results, establishing a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet dataset. We further demonstrate that the pre-trained model has good transferability to the CIFAR-10 dataset, suggesting its wide adaptability. Models and code are available at

Omnigrok: Grokking Beyond Algorithmic Data,"Grokking, the unusual phenomenon for algorithmic datasets where generalization happens long after overfitting the training data, has remained elusive. We aim to understand grokking by analyzing the loss landscapes of neural networks, identifying the mismatch between training and test losses as the cause for grokking. We refer to this as the ""LU mechanism"" because training and test losses (against model weight norm) typically resemble ""L"" and ""U"", respectively. This simple mechanism can nicely explain many aspects of grokking: data size dependence, weight decay dependence, the emergence of representations, etc. Guided by the intuitive picture, we are able to induce grokking on tasks involving images, language and molecules, although the grokking signals are sometimes less dramatic. We attribute the dramatic nature of grokking for algorithmic datasets to representation learning.",1
TiAda: A Time-scale Adaptive Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimax Optimization,"Adaptive gradient methods have shown their ability to adjust the stepsizes on the fly in a parameter-agnostic manner, and empirically achieve faster convergence for solving minimization problems. When it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic and can achieve near-optimal complexities simultaneously in deterministic and stochastic settings of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further justified numerically for a number of machine learning applications.",1
Knowledge Unlearning for Mitigating Privacy Risks in Language Models,"Pretrained Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of knowledge during initial pretraining, including information that may violate the privacy of personal lives and identities. Previous work addressing privacy issues for language models has mostly focused on data preprocessing and differential privacy methods, both requiring re-training the underlying LM. We propose knowledge unlearning as an alternative method to reduce privacy risks for LMs post hoc. We show that simply applying the unlikelihood training objective to target token sequences is effective at forgetting them with little to no degradation of general language modeling performances; it sometimes even substantially improves the underlying LM with just a few iterations. We also find that sequential unlearning is better than trying to unlearn all the data at once and that unlearning is highly dependent on which kind of data (domain) is forgotten. By showing comparisons with a previous data preprocessing method known to mitigate privacy risks for LMs, we show that unlearning can give a stronger empirical privacy guarantee in scenarios where the data vulnerable to extraction attacks are known a priori while being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. We release the code and dataset needed to replicate our results at http://www.omitted.link/.",0
Interpreting Distributional Reinforcement Learning: A Regularization Perspective,"Distributional reinforcement learning~(RL) is a class of state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the entire distribution of the total return rather than its expected value alone. The theoretical advantages of distributional RL over expectation-based RL remain elusive, despite the remarkable performance of distributional RL. Our work attributes the superiority of distributional RL to its regularization effect stemming from the value distribution information regardless of only its expectation. We decompose the value distribution into its expectation and the remaining distribution part using a variant of the gross error model in robust statistics. Hence, distributional RL has an additional benefit over expectation-based RL thanks to the impact of a \textit{risk-sensitive entropy regularization} within the Neural Fitted Z-Iteration framework. Meanwhile, we investigate the role of the resulting regularization in actor-critic algorithms by bridging the risk-sensitive entropy regularization of distributional RL and the vanilla entropy in maximum entropy RL. It reveals that distributional RL induces an augmented reward function, which promotes a risk-sensitive exploration against the intrinsic uncertainty of the environment. Finally, extensive experiments verify the importance of the regularization effect in distributional RL, as well as the mutual impacts of different entropy regularizations. Our study paves the way towards a better understanding of distributional RL, especially when looked at through a regularization lens.",0
How hard are computer vision datasets? Calibrating dataset difficulty to viewing time,"Humans outperform object recognizers despite the fact that models perform well on current datasets. Numerous attempts have been made to create more challenging datasets by scaling them up from the web, exploring distribution shift, or adding controls for biases. The difficulty of each image in each dataset is not independently evaluated, nor is the concept of dataset difficulty as a whole well-posed. We develop a new dataset difficulty metric based on how long humans must view an image in order to classify a target object. Images whose objects can be recognized in 17ms are considered to be easier than those which require seconds of viewing time. Using 133,588 judgments on two major datasets, ImageNet and ObjectNet, we determine the distribution of image difficulties in those datasets, which we find varies wildly, but significantly undersamples hard images. Rather than hoping that distribution shift or other approaches will lead to hard datasets, we should measure the difficulty of datasets and seek to explicitly fill out the class of difficult examples. Analyzing model performance guided by image difficulty reveals that models tend to have lower performance and a larger generalization gap on harder images. Encouragingly for the biological validity of current architectures, much of the variance in human difficulty can be accounted for given an object recognizer by computing a combination of prediction depth, c-score, and adversarial robustness. We release a dataset of such judgments as a complementary metric to raw performance and a network’s ability to explain neural recordings. Such experiments with humans allow us to create a metric for progress in object recognition datasets, which we find are skewed toward easy examples, to test the biological validity of models in a novel way, and to develop tools for shaping datasets as they are being gathered to focus them on filling out the missing class of hard examples from today’s datasets. Dataset and analysis code can be found at https://github.com/image-flash/image-flash-2022.",0
Competitive Physics Informed Networks ,"Neural networks can be trained to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by using the PDE residual as the loss function. This strategy is called ""physics-informed neural networks"" (PINNs), but it currently cannot produce high-accuracy solutions, typically attaining about $0.1\%$ relative error. We present an adversarial approach that overcomes this limitation, which we call competitive PINNs (CPINNs). CPINNs train a discriminator that is rewarded for predicting mistakes the PINN makes. The discriminator and PINN participate in a zero-sum game with the exact PDE solution as an optimal strategy. This approach avoids squaring the large condition numbers of PDE discretizations, which is the likely reason for failures of previous attempts to decrease PINN errors even on benign problems. Numerical experiments on a Poisson problem show that CPINNs achieve errors four orders of magnitude smaller than the best-performing PINN. We observe relative errors on the order of single-precision accuracy, consistently decreasing with each epoch. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time this level of accuracy and convergence behavior has been achieved. Additional experiments on the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger, Burgers', and Allen--Cahn equation show that the benefits of CPINNs are not limited to linear problems.",1
Phase2vec: dynamical systems embedding with a physics-informed convolutional network,"Dynamical systems are found in innumerable forms across the physical and biological sciences, yet all these systems fall naturally into equivalence classes: conservative or dissipative, stable or unstable, compressible or incompressible. Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics on which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, phase2vec, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of low-dimensional dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also produces embeddings that encode meaningful physical properties of input data (e.g. stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows) more faithfully than standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We additionally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems.",1
Winning Both the Accuracy of Floating Point Activation and the Simplicity of Integer Arithmetic,"Even though floating point (FP) numbers have been adopted as a de facto standard data format for deep learning computing, the complexity of FP arithmetic impedes a broader deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Recent works such as quantization have attempted to replace the FP matrix multiplication (MatMul) of DNNs with simple integer MatMul by transforming the datatypes of both weights and activations into integers. Unfortunately, unlike weight values that are static, it is challenging to represent dynamic activations with integers. In this paper, to simultaneously achieve the accuracy of FP activation and the simplicity of integer arithmetic, we present a method for replacing FP arithmetic with integer one without changing FP activations in the storage format while weights are quantized. The proposed method pre-aligns the significands of FP activations just ahead of the MatMul on-the-fly so that the aligned significands (integers) can be used for the computation. Inspired by an observation that conventional FP arithmetic does not produce precise results due to rounding, we demonstrate that our proposed integer arithmetic-based scheme can produce the same level of errors as that of the FP arithmetic in case DNNs use FP activations and quantized weights. Experimental results show that the hardware based on the proposed scheme shows significant improvement over FP arithmetic-based designs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput-per-area while maintaining a similar level of accuracy.",1
Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning,"Deep offline reinforcement learning has recently demonstrated considerable promise in leveraging offline datasets, providing high-quality models that significantly reduce the online interactions required for fine-tuning. However, such a benefit is often diminished due to the marked state-action distribution shift, which causes significant bootstrap error and wipes out the good initial policy. Existing solutions resort to constraining the policy shift or balancing the sample replay based on their online-ness. However, they require online estimation of distribution divergence or density ratio. To avoid such complications, we propose deviating from existing actor-critic approaches that directly transfer the state-action value functions. Instead, we post-process them by aligning with the offline learned policy, so that the Q-values for actions *outside* the offline policy are also tamed. As a result, the online fine-tuning can be simply performed as in the standard actor-critic algorithms. We show empirically that the proposed method improves the performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents on various simulated tasks.",0
On the Soft-Subnetwork for Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning,"Inspired by Regularized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which states that competitive smooth (non-binary) subnetworks exist within a dense network, we propose a few-shot class-incremental learning method referred to as Soft-SubNetworks (SoftNet). Our objective is to learn a sequence of sessions incrementally, where each session only includes a few training instances per class while preserving the knowledge of the previously learned ones. SoftNet jointly learns the model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session in which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims to minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to avoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session. We provide comprehensive empirical validations demonstrating that our SoftNet effectively tackles the few-shot incremental learning problem by surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art baselines over benchmark datasets.",1
Auxiliary task discovery through generate and test,"In this paper, we explore an approach to auxiliary task discovery in reinforcement learning based on ideas from representation learning. Auxiliary tasks tend to improve data efficiency by forcing the agent to learn auxiliary prediction and control objectives in addition to the main task of maximizing reward, and thus producing better representations. Typically these tasks are designed by people. Meta-learning offers a promising avenue for automatic task discovery; however, these methods are computationally expensive and challenging to tune in practice. In this paper, we explore a complementary approach to the auxiliary task discovery: continually generating new auxiliary tasks and preserving only those with high utility. We also introduce a new measure of auxiliary tasks' usefulness based on how useful the features induced by them are for the main task. Our discovery algorithm significantly outperforms random tasks, hand-designed tasks, and learning without auxiliary tasks across a suite of environments. ",0
Red PANDA: Disambiguating Image Anomaly Detection by Removing Nuisance Factors,"Anomaly detection methods strive to discover patterns that differ from the norm in a meaningful way. This goal is ambiguous as different human operators may find different attributes meaningful. An image differing from the norm by an attribute such as pose may be considered anomalous by some operators while others may consider the attribute irrelevant. Breaking from previous research, we present a new anomaly detection method that allows operators to exclude an attribute when detecting anomalies. Our approach aims to learn representations which do not contain information regarding such nuisance attributes. Anomaly scoring is performed using a density-based approach. Importantly, our approach does not require specifying the attributes where anomalies could appear, which is typically impossible in anomaly detection, but only attributes to ignore. An empirical investigation is presented verifying the effectiveness of our approach.",1
Name Your Colour For the Task: Artificially Discover Colour Naming via Colour Quantisation Transformer,"The long-standing theory that a colour-naming system evolves under the dual pressure of efficient communication and perceptual mechanism is supported by more and more linguistic studies including the analysis of  four decades’ diachronic data from the Nafaanra language.  This inspires us to explore whether artificial intelligence could evolve and discover a similar colour-naming system via optimising the communication efficiency represented by high-level recognition performance. Here, we propose a novel colour quantisation transformer, CQFormer, that quantises colour space while maintaining the accuracy of machine recognition on the quantised image. Given an RGB image, the annotation branch maps it into an index map before generating the quantised image with a colour palette, meanwhile the palette branch utilises a key-point detection way to find proper colours in palette among whole colour space. By interacting with colour annotation,  CQFormer is able to balance both the machine vision accuracy and colour perceptual structure such as distinct and stable colour distribution for discovered colour system. Very interestingly, we even observe the consistent evolution pattern between our artificial colour  system and basic colour terms across human languages. Besides, our colour quantisation method also offers an efficient quantisation method that effectively compresses the image storage while maintaining a high performance in high-level recognition tasks such as classification and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method with extremely low bit-rate colours. We will release the source code upon acceptance. ",0
"Plateau in Monotonic Linear Interpolation --- A ""Biased"" View of Loss Landscape for Deep Networks","Monotonic linear interpolation (MLI) --- on the line connecting a random initialization with the minimizer it converges to, the loss and accuracy are monotonic --- is a phenomenon that is commonly observed in the training of neural networks. Such a  phenomenon may seem to suggest that optimization of neural networks is easy. In this paper, we show that the MLI property is not necessarily related to the hardness of optimization problems, and empirical observations on MLI for deep neural networks depend heavily on the biases. In particular, we show that interpolating both weights and biases linearly leads to very different influences on the final output, and when different classes have different last-layer biases on a deep network, there will be a long plateau in both the loss and accuracy interpolation (which existing theory of MLI cannot explain). We also show how the last-layer biases for different classes can be different even on a perfectly balanced dataset using a simple model. Empirically we demonstrate that similar intuitions hold on practical networks and realistic datasets.",1
Learning in temporally structured environments,"Natural environments have temporal structure at multiple timescales. This property is reflected in biological learning and memory but typically not in machine learning systems. We advance a multiscale learning method in which each weight in a neural network is decomposed as a sum of subweights with different learning and decay rates. Thus knowledge becomes distributed across different timescales, enabling rapid adaptation to task changes while avoiding catastrophic interference. First, we prove previous models that learn at multiple timescales, but with complex coupling between timescales, are equivalent to multiscale learning via a reparameterization that eliminates this coupling. The same analysis yields a new characterization of momentum learning, as a fast weight with a negative learning rate. Second, we derive a model of Bayesian inference over $1/f$ noise, a common temporal pattern in many online learning domains that involves long-range (power law) autocorrelations. The generative side of the model expresses $1/f$ noise as a sum of diffusion processes at different timescales, and the inferential side tracks these latent processes using a Kalman filter. We then derive a variational approximation to the Bayesian model and show how it is an extension of the multiscale learner. The result is an optimizer that can be used as a drop-in replacement in an arbitrary neural network architecture. Third, we evaluate the ability of these methods to handle nonstationarity by testing them in online prediction tasks characterized by $1/f$ noise in the latent parameters. We find that the Bayesian model significantly outperforms online stochastic gradient descent and two batch heuristics that rely preferentially or exclusively on more recent data. Moreover, the variational approximation performs nearly as well as the full Bayesian model, and with memory requirements that are linear in the size of the network.

Learning Efficient Models From Few Labels By Distillation From Multiple Tasks,"We address the challenge of getting efficient yet accurate recognition systems that can be trained with limited labels. Many specialized applications of computer vision (e.g. analyzing X-rays or satellite images) have severe resource constraints both during training and inference. While transfer learning is an effective solution for training on small labeled datasets it still often requires a large base model for fine-tuning. In this paper we present a weighted multi-source distillation method; we distill multiple (diverse) source models trained on different domains, weighted by their relevance for the target task, into a single efficient model using limited labeled data. When the goal is accurate recognition under computational constraints, our approach outperforms both transfer learning from strong ImageNet initializations as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques such as FixMatch. When averaged over 8 diverse target tasks our method outperform the baselines by 5.6%-points and 4.5%-points, respectively.",0
Have Missing Data? Make It Miss More! Imputing Tabular Data with Masked Autoencoding,"We present ReMasker, a novel method for imputing missing values in tabular data by extending the masked autoencoding framework. In contrast to prior work, ReMasker is both {\em simple} -- besides the missing values (i.e., naturally masked), we randomly ``re-mask'' another set of values, optimize the autoencoder by reconstructing this re-masked set, and apply the trained model to predict the missing values; and {\em effective} -- with extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that ReMasker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both imputation fidelity and utility under various missingness settings, while its performance advantage often increases with the ratio of missing data. We further explore theoretical justification for its effectiveness, showing that ReMasker tends to learn missingness-invariant representations of tabular data. Our findings indicate that masked modeling represents a promising direction for further research on tabular data imputation.",0
Gradient-Informed Quality Diversity for the Illumination of Discrete Spaces,"Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proposed to search for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions instead of a single set of local optima. While early QD algorithms view the objective and descriptor functions as black-box functions, novel tools have been introduced to use gradient information to accelerate the search and improve overall performance of those algorithms over continuous input spaces. However a broad range of applications involve discrete spaces, such as drug discovery or image generation. Exploring those spaces is challenging as they are combinatorially large and gradients cannot be used in the same manner as in continuous spaces. We introduce MAP-Elites with a Gradient-Informed Discrete Emitter (ME-GIDE), which extends QD optimisation with differentiable functions over discrete search spaces. ME-GIDE leverages the gradient information of the objective and descriptor functions with respect to its discrete inputs to propose gradient-informed updates that guide the search towards a diverse set of high quality solutions. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks including protein design and discrete latent space illumination and find that our method outperforms state-of-the-art QD algorithms in all benchmarks.

AnyDA: Anytime Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation is an open and challenging problem in computer vision. While existing research shows encouraging results in addressing cross-domain distribution shift on common benchmarks, they are often constrained to testing under a specific target setting, limiting their impact for many real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for anytime domain adaptation that is executable with dynamic resource constraints to achieve accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under domain-shifts. We achieve this by training a single shared network using both labeled source and unlabeled data, with switchable depth, width and input resolutions on the fly to enable testing under a wide range of computation budgets. Starting with a teacher network trained from a label-rich source domain, we utilize bootstrapped recursive knowledge distillation as a nexus between source and target domains to jointly train the student network with switchable subnetworks. Experiments on multiple datasets well demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.",1
Hybrid RL: Using both offline and online data can make RL efficient,"We consider a hybrid reinforcement learning setting (Hybrid RL), in which an agent has access to an offline dataset and the ability to collect experience via real-world online interaction. The framework mitigates the challenges that arise in both pure offline and online RL settings, allowing for the design of simple and highly effective algorithms, in both theory and practice. We demonstrate these advantages by adapting the classical Q learning/iteration algorithm to the hybrid setting, which we call Hybrid Q-Learning or Hy-Q. In our theoretical results, we prove that the algorithm is both computationally and statistically efficient whenever the offline dataset supports a high-quality policy and the environment has bounded bilinear rank. Notably, we require no assumptions on the coverage provided by the initial distribution, in contrast with guarantees for policy gradient/iteration methods. In our experimental results, we show that Hy-Q with neural network function approximation outperforms state-of-the-art online, offline, and hybrid RL baselines on challenging benchmarks, including Montezuma’s Revenge.",1
Minimum Curvature Manifold Learning,"It is widely observed that vanilla autoencoders can have low manifold learning accuracy given a noisy or small training dataset. 
Recent work has discovered that it is important to regularize the decoder that explicitly parameterizes the manifold, 
where a neighborhood graph is employed for decoder regularization. However, one caveat of this method is that it is not always straightforward to construct a correct graph. Alternatively, one may consider naive graph-free regularization methods such as minimizing the norm of the decoder's Jacobian or Hessian, but these norms are not coordinate-invariant (i.e. reparametrization-invariant) and hence do not capture any meaningful geometric quantity of the manifold nor result in geometrically meaningful manifold regularization effects. 
Another recent work called the isometric regularization implicitly forces the manifold to have zero intrinsic curvature, resulting in some geometrically meaningful regularization effects. But, since the intrinsic curvature does not capture how the manifold is embedded in the data space from an extrinsic perspective, the regularization effects are often limited. In this paper, we propose a {\it minimum extrinsic curvature principle} for manifold regularization and {\bf Minimum Curvature Autoencoder (MCAE)}, a graph-free coordinate-invariant extrinsic curvature minimization framework for autoencoder regularization. Experiments with various standard datasets demonstrate that MCAE improves manifold learning accuracy compared to existing methods, especially showing strong robustness to noise.",0
Formal Specifications from Natural Language,"We study the generalization abilities of language models when translating natural language into formal specifications with complex semantics. In particular, we fine-tune language models on three datasets consisting of English sentences and their corresponding formal representation: 1) regular expressions (regex), frequently used in programming and search; 2) First-order logic (FOL), commonly used in software verification and theorem proving; and 3) linear-time temporal logic (LTL), which forms the basis for industrial hardware specification languages. Our experiments show that, in these diverse domains, the language models maintain their generalization capabilities from pre-trained knowledge of natural language to generalize, e.g., to new variable names or operator descriptions. Additionally, they achieve competitive performance, and even outperform the state-of-the-art for translating into regular expressions, with the benefits of being easy to access, efficient to fine-tune, and without a particular need for domain-specific reasoning.",0
Scalable 3D Object-centric Learning,"We tackle the task of unsupervised 3D object-centric representation learning on scenes of potentially unbounded scale. 
  Existing approaches to object-centric representation learning exhibit significant limitations in achieving scalable inference due to their dependencies on a fixed global coordinate system. 
  In contrast, we propose to learn view-invariant 3D object representations in localized object coordinate systems. 
  To this end, we estimate the object pose and appearance representation separately and explicitly project object representations across views. 
  We adopt amortized variational inference to process sequential input and update object representations online. 
  To scale up our model to scenes with an arbitrary number of objects, we further introduce a Cognitive Map that allows the registration and querying of objects on a global map. 
  We employ the object-centric neural radiance field (NeRF) as our 3D scene representation, which is jointly inferred by our unsupervised object-centric learning framework. 
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method can infer and maintain object-centric representations of unbounded 3D scenes. 
  Further combined with a per-object NeRF finetuning process, our model can achieve scalable high-quality object-aware scene reconstruction.",0
Scalable Multi-Modal Continual Meta-Learning,"This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are sequentially available and sampled from a non-stationary distribution. Motivated by this challenging setting, many works have been developed with a mixture of meta-knowledge to cope with the heterogeneity and a dynamically changing number of components to capture incremental information. However, the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components prevents sharing meta-knowledge across different clusters of tasks. Moreover, the existing incremental methods only rely on the prior to determine whether to increase meta-knowledge, where the unlimited increase would lead to parameter inefficiency. In our work, we propose a Scalable Multi-Modal Continual Meta-Learning (SMM-CML) algorithm. It employs a multi-modal premise that not only encourages different clusters of tasks to share meta-knowledge but also maintains their diversity. Moreover, to capture the incremental information, our algorithm uses Indian Buffet Process (IBP) as a prior number of components and proposes a sparsity method based on evidential theory to filter out the components without receiving support information directly from tasks. Thus we can learn the posterior number of components to avoid parameter inefficiency and reduce computational consumption. Experiments show SMM-CML outperforms SOTA baselines, which illustrates the effectiveness of our multi-modal meta-knowledge, and confirms that our algorithm can learn the really need meta-knowledge from tasks.",0
EPISODE: Episodic Gradient Clipping with Periodic Resampled Corrections for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data," Gradient clipping is an important technique for deep neural networks with exploding gradients, such as recurrent neural networks. Recent studies have shown that the loss functions of these networks do not satisfy the conventional smoothness condition, but instead satisfy a relaxed smoothness condition, i.e., the Lipschitz constant of the gradient scales linearly in terms of the gradient norm. Due to this observation, several gradient clipping algorithms have been developed for nonconvex and relaxed-smooth functions. However, the existing algorithms only apply to the single-machine or multiple-machine setting with homogeneous data across machines. It remains unclear how to design provably efficient gradient clipping algorithms in the general Federated Learning (FL) setting with heterogeneous data and limited communication rounds. In this paper, we design EPISODE, the very first algorithm to solve FL problems with heterogeneous data in the nonconvex and relaxed smoothness setting. The key ingredients of the algorithm are two new techniques called \textit{episodic gradient clipping} and \textit{periodic resampled corrections}. At the beginning of each round, EPISODE resamples stochastic gradients from each client and obtains the global averaged gradient, which is used to (1) determine whether to apply gradient clipping for the entire round and (2) construct local gradient corrections for each client. Notably, our algorithm and analysis provide a unified framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data under any noise level of the stochastic gradient, and it achieves state-of-the-art complexity results. In particular, we prove that EPISODE can achieve linear speedup in the number of machines, and it requires significantly fewer communication rounds. Experiments on several heterogeneous datasets, including text classification and image classification, show the superior performance of EPISODE over several strong baselines in FL. The code is available at https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/episode.",1
An Experiment Design Paradigm using Joint Feature Selection and Task Optimization,"This paper presents a subsampling-task paradigm for data-driven task-specific experiment design (ED) and a novel method in populationwide supervised feature selection (FS).  Optimal ED, the choice of sampling points under constraints of limited acquisition-time, arises in a wide variety of scientific and engineering contexts. However the continuous optimization used in classical approaches depend on a-priori parameter choices and challenging non-convex optimization landscapes.  This paper proposes to replace this strategy with a subsampling-task paradigm, analogous to populationwide supervised FS.  In particular, we introduce JOFSTO, which performs JOint Feature Selection and Task Optimization.  JOFSTO jointly optimizes two coupled networks: one for feature scoring, which provides the ED, the other for execution of a downstream task or process.  Unlike most FS problems, e.g. selecting protein expressions for classification, ED problems typically select from highly correlated globally informative candidates rather than seeking a small number of highly informative features among many uninformative features.  JOFSTO's construction efficiently identifies potentially correlated, but effective subsets and returns a trained task network.  We demonstrate the approach using parameter estimation and mapping problems in quantitative MRI, where economical ED is crucial for clinical application.  Results from simulations and empirical data show the subsampling-task paradigm strongly outperforms classical ED, and within our paradigm, JOFSTO outperforms state-of-the-art supervised FS techniques.  JOFSTO extends immediately to wider image-based ED problems and other scenarios where the design must be specified globally across large numbers of acquisitions.  Our code is available for reviewers https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qe6vb1w6fuf869hx4ht0k/h?dl=0&rlkey=og8czcorurl57jbiixio7hcjt ",0
SwinZS3: Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation with a Swin Transformer,"Zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3) aims at learning to classify the never-seen classes with zero training samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great success in this task. However, their limited attention ability constraints existing network architectures to reason based on word embeddings. In this light of the recent successes achieved by Swin Transformers, we propose SwinZS3, a new framework exploiting the visual embeddings and semantic embeddings on joint embedding space. The SwinZS3 combines a transformer image encoder with a language encoder. The image encoder is trained by pixel-text score maps using the dense language-guided semantic prototypes which are computed by the language encoder. This allows the SwinZS3 could recognize the unseen classes at test time without retraining. We experiment with our method on the  ZS3 standard benchmarks (PASCAL VOC and PASCAL Context) and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing the state-of-art performance.",0
Reinforcement Logic Rule Learning for Temporal Point Processes ,"We aim to learn a set of temporal logic rules to explain the occurrence of temporal events. Leveraging the temporal point process modeling and learning framework, the rule content and rule weights are jointly learned by maximizing the likelihood of the observed noisy event sequences. The proposed algorithm alternates between a master problem, where the rule weights are updated, and a subproblem, where a new rule is searched and included. The formulated master problem is convex and relatively easy to solve, whereas the subproblem requires searching the huge combinatorial rule predicate and relationship space. To tackle this challenge, we propose a neural search policy to learn to generate the new rule content as a sequence of actions. The policy parameters will be trained end-to-end using the reinforcement learning framework, where the reward signals can be efficiently queried by evaluating the subproblem objective. The trained policy can be used to generate new rules, and moreover, the well-trained policies can be directly transferred to other tasks to speed up the rule searching procedure in the new task. We evaluate our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, obtaining promising results.",0
SoftMatch: Addressing the Quantity-Quality Tradeoff in Semi-supervised Learning,"The critical challenge of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is how to effectively leverage the limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data to improve the model's generalization performance. In this paper, we first revisit the popular pseudo-labeling methods via a unified sample weighting formulation and demonstrate the inherent quantity-quality trade-off problem of pseudo-labeling with thresholding, which may prohibit learning. To this end, we propose SoftMatch to overcome the trade-off by maintaining both high quantity and high quality of pseudo-labels during training, effectively exploiting the unlabeled data. We derive a truncated Gaussian function to weight samples based on their confidence, which can be viewed as a soft version of the confidence threshold. We further enhance the utilization of weakly-learned classes by proposing a uniform alignment approach. In experiments, SoftMatch shows substantial improvements across a wide variety of benchmarks, including image, text, and imbalanced classification.",1
Classically Approximating Variational Quantum Machine Learning with Random Fourier Features,"Many applications of quantum computing in the near term rely on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). They have been showcased as a promising model for reaching a quantum advantage in machine learning with current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ). It is often believed that the power of VQCs relies on their exponentially large feature space, and extensive works have explored the expressiveness and trainability of VQCs in that regard. In our work, we propose a classical sampling method that can closely approximate most VQCs with Hamiltonian encoding, given only the description of their architecture. It uses the seminal proposal of Random Fourier Features (RFF) and the fact that VQCs can be seen as large Fourier series. We show theoretically and experimentally that models built from exponentially large quantum feature space can be classically reproduced by sampling a few frequencies to build an equivalent low dimensional kernel. Precisely, we show that the number of required samples grows favourably with the size of the quantum spectrum. This tool therefore questions the hope for quantum advantage from VQCs in many cases, but conversely helps to narrow the conditions for their potential success. We expect VQCs with various and complex encoding Hamiltonians, or with large input dimension, to become more robust to classical approximations.",1
Topology-aware Robust Optimization for Out-of-Distribution Generalization,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a challenging machine learning problem yet highly desirable in many high-stake applications. 
Existing methods suffer from overly pessimistic modeling with low generalization confidence. As generalizing to arbitrary test distributions is impossible, we hypothesize that further structure on the topology of distributions is crucial in developing strong OOD resilience. To this end, we propose topology-aware robust optimization (TRO) that seamlessly integrates distributional topology in a principled optimization framework. More specifically, TRO solves two optimization objectives: (1) Topology Learning which explores data manifold to uncover the distributional topology; (2) Learning on Topology which exploits the topology to constrain robust optimization for tightly-bounded generalization risks. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of the arts in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and semantic segmentation. Moreover, we empirically find the data-driven distributional topology is consistent with domain knowledge, enhancing the explainability of our approach. ",1
$z$-SignFedAvg: A Unified  Stochastic Sign-based Compression for Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm but suffers from high communication cost when training large-scale machine learning models.  Sign-based methods,  such as SignSGD \citep{bernstein2018signsgd},  have been proposed as a biased gradient compression technique for reducing the communication cost. However,  sign-based algorithms could diverge under heterogeneous data, which thus motivated the development of advanced techniques, such as the error-feedback method and stochastic sign-based compression, to fix this issue.
Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from slower convergence rates. Besides, none of them allows multiple local SGD updates like FedAvg \citep{mcmahan2017communication}.  In this paper,  we propose a novel noisy perturbation scheme with a general symmetric noise distribution for sign-based compression, which not only allows one to flexibly control the tradeoff between gradient bias and convergence performance, but also provides a unified viewpoint to existing stochastic sign-based methods.  More importantly,  we propose the very first sign-based FedAvg algorithm ($z$-SignFedAvg). Theoretically,  we show that $z$-SignFedAvg achieves a faster convergence rate than existing sign-based methods and,  under the uniformly distributed noise, can enjoy the same convergence rate as its uncompressed counterpart. Last but not the least,  we remark that adding random noise to the local gradients has a double benefit: it protects the clients' privacy by, e.g., the Differential Privacy. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the $z$-SignFedAvg can achieve competitive empirical performance on real datasets. ",0
Multi-Behavior Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Recommendation,"Dynamic behavior modeling has become an essential task in personalized recommender systems for learning the time-evolving user preference in online platforms. However, most next-item recommendation methods follow the single type behavior learning manner, which notably limits their user representation performance in reality, since the user-item relationships are often multi-typed in real-life applications (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, review and purchase). To offer better recommendations, this work proposes Evolving Graph Contrastive Memory Network (EGCM) to model dynamic interaction heterogeneity for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. Specifically, we first develop a multi-behavior graph encoder to capture the short-term preference heterogeneity, and preserve the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. In addition, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network, empowering EGCM to distill the long-term multi-behavior preference of users and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To enhance the user representation with multi-behavior commonality and diversity, we design a multi-behavior contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. Experiments on several real-world datasets show the superiority of our recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines.",0
Exploring Neural Network Representational Similarity using Filter Subspaces,"Analyzing representational similarity in neural networks is crucial to numerous tasks, such as interpreting or transferring deep models. One typical approach is to input probing data into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as stimuli to reveal their deep representation for model similarity analysis. Those methods are often computationally expensive and stimulus-dependent. By representing filter subspace in a CNN as a set of filter atoms, previous work has reported competitive performance in continual learning by learning a different set of filter atoms for each task while sharing common atom coefficients across tasks. Inspired by this observation, in this paper, we propose a new paradigm for reducing representational similarity analysis in CNNs to filter subspace distance assessment. Specifically, when filter atom coefficients are shared across networks, model representational similarity can be significantly simplified as calculating the cosine distance among respective filter atoms, to achieve \textit{millions of times} computation reduction. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this simplified filter subspace-based similarity preserves a strong linear correlation with other popular stimulus-based metrics, while being significantly more efficient and robust to probing data. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various applications, such as analyzing training dynamics as well as in federated and continual learning. We hope our findings can help further explorations of real-time large-scale representational similarity analysis in neural networks.",0
Generative Model Based Noise Robust Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Target domain pseudo-labeling has shown effectiveness in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, pseudo-labels of unlabeled target domain data are inevitably noisy due to the distribution shift between source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a generative model-based noise-robust training method (GeMo-NoRT), serving for domain shift elimination and label noise robustness simultaneously. GeMo-NoRT incorporates a distribution-based class-wise feature augmentation (D-CFA) and a generative-discriminative classifier consistency (GDC), both based on the class-wise target distributions modeled by generative models. D-CFA minimizes the domain gap by augmenting the source data with distribution-sampled target features, and trains a noise-robust discriminative classifier by using target domain knowledge from the generative models. GDC regards all the class-wise generative models as a generative classifier and enforces a consistency regularization between the generative and discriminative classifiers. It exploits an ensemble of target knowledge from all the generative models to train a noise-robust discriminative classifier, and eventually gets theoretically linked to the Ben-David domain adaptation theorem for reducing domain gap. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, PACS, and Digit-Five show that our GeMo-NoRT achieves state of the art under single-source and multi-source UDA settings.",0
Mutual Information Regularized Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning an effective policy from offline datasets without active interactions with the environment. The major challenge of offline RL is the distribution shift that appears when out-of-distribution actions are queried, which makes the policy improvement direction biased by extrapolation errors. Most existing methods address this problem by penalizing the policy for deviating from the behavior policy during policy improvement or making conservative updates for value functions during policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel MISA framework to approach offline RL from the perspective of Mutual Information between States and Actions in the dataset by directly constraining the policy improvement direction. Intuitively, mutual information measures the mutual dependence of actions and states, which reflects how a behavior agent reacts to certain environment states during data collection. To effectively utilize this information to facilitate policy learning, MISA constructs lower bounds of mutual information parameterized by the policy and Q-values. We show that optimizing this lower bound is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a one-step improved policy on the offline dataset. In this way, we constrain the policy improvement direction to lie in the data manifold. The resulting algorithm simultaneously augments the policy evaluation and improvement by adding a mutual information regularization. MISA is a general offline RL framework that unifies conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior regularization methods (e.g., TD3+BC) as special cases. Our experiments show that MISA performs significantly better than existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art on various tasks of the D4RL benchmark.",0
Closed Boundary Learning for NLP Classification Tasks with the Universum Class,"The Universum class, often known as the other class or the miscellaneous class, is defined as a collection of samples that do not belong to any class of interest. It is a typical class that exists in many classification-based tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as relation extraction, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, etc. During data labeling, a significant number of samples are annotated as Universum because there are always some samples that exist in the dataset but do not belong to preset target classes and are not of interest in the task. The Universum class exhibits very different properties, namely heterogeneity and lack of representativeness in training data; however, existing methods often treat the Universum class equally with the classes of interest. Although the Universum class only contains uninterested samples, improper treatment will result in the misclassification of samples of interest. In this work, we propose a closed boundary learning method that treats the Universum class and classes of interest differently. We apply closed decision boundaries to classes of interest and designate the area outside all closed boundaries in the feature space as the space of the Universum class. Specifically, we formulate the closed boundaries as arbitrary shapes, propose a strategy to estimate the probability of the Universum class according to its unique property rather than the within-class sample distribution, and propose a boundary learning loss to learn decision boundaries based on the balance of misclassified samples inside and outside the boundary. We evaluate our method on 6 state-of-the-art works in 3 different tasks, and the performance of all 6 works is improved. Our code will be released on GitHub.",0
Complexity-Based Prompting for Multi-step Reasoning,"We study the task of prompting large-scale language models to perform multi-step reasoning. Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, large language models can generate new reasoning chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexity-based prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step reasoning. We show that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on math word reasoning tasks over strong baselines. We further extend our complexity-based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority
of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains). When used to prompt GPT-3, our approach substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy, with an 8.6% absolute improvement on GSM8K, and 6.4% on MathQA. Compared with existing example selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient. Further results demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift.",1
CRISP: Curriculum inducing Primitive Informed Subgoal Prediction for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising approach that uses temporal abstraction to solve complex long horizon problems. However, simultaneously learning a hierarchy of policies is unstable as it is challenging to train higher-level policy when the lower-level primitive is non-stationary. In this paper, we propose to generate a curriculum of achievable subgoals for evolving lower-level primitives using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. The lower level primitive periodically performs data relabeling on a handful of expert demonstrations using our primitive informed parsing method. We derive expressions to bound the sub-optimality of our method and develop a practical algorithm for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Since our approach uses a handful of expert demonstrations, it is suitable for most real world robotic control tasks. Experimental results on complex maze navigation and robotic manipulation environments show that inducing hierarchical curriculum learning significantly improves sample efficiency, and results in better learning of goal conditioned policies in complex temporally extended tasks.

Approximated Anomalous Diffusion: Gaussian Mixture Score-based Generative Models,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) can generate high-quality samples via Langevin dynamics with a drift term and a diffusion term (Gaussian noise) iteratively calculated and added to a sample until convergence. In biological systems, it is observed that the neural population can conduct heavy-tailed L\'{e}vy dynamics for sampling-based probabilistic representation through neural fluctuations. Critically, unlike the existing sampling process of SGMs, L\'{e}vy dynamics can produce both large jumps and small roaming to explore the sampling space, resulting in better sampling results than Langevin dynamics with a lacking of large jumps. Motivated by this contrast, we explore a new class of SGMs with the sampling based on the L\'{e}vy dynamics. However, exact numerical simulation of the L\'{e}vy dynamics is significantly more challenging and intractable. We hence propose an approximation solution by leveraging Gaussian mixture noises during training to achieve the desired large jumps and small roaming properties. Theoretically, GM-SGMs conduct a probabilistic graphical model used by empirical Bayes for sampling, expanding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation applied by conventional SGMs. Expensive experiments on the challenging image generation tasks show that our GM-SGMs exhibit superior sampling quality over prior art SGMs across various sampling iterations.",0
Data-Efficient and Interpretable Tabular Anomaly Detection,"Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in numerous applications. In this paper, we focus on two understudied aspects of AD that are critical for integration into real-world applications. First, most AD methods cannot incorporate labeled data that are often available in practice in small quantities and can be crucial to achieve high accuracy. Second, most AD methods are not interpretable, a bottleneck that prevents stakeholders from understanding the reason behind the anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework, DIAD, that adapts a white-box model class, Generalized Additive Models, to detect anomalies using a partial identification objective which naturally handles noisy or heterogeneous features. DIAD can incorporate a small amount of labeled data to further boost AD performances in semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate the superiority of DIAD compared to previous work in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings on multiple datasets. We also present explainability capabilities of DIAD, on its rationale behind predicting certain samples as anomalies.",0
Distribution Shift Detection for Deep Neural Networks,"To deploy and operate deep neural models in production, the quality of their predictions, which might be contaminated benignly or manipulated maliciously by input distributional deviations, must be monitored and assessed. Specifically, we study the case of monitoring the healthy operation of a deep neural network (DNN) receiving a stream of data, with the aim of detecting input distributional deviations over which the quality of the network's predictions is potentially damaged. Using selective prediction principles, we propose a distribution deviation detection method for DNNs. The proposed method is derived from a tight coverage generalization bound computed over a sample of instances drawn from the true underlying distribution. Based on this bound, our detector continuously monitors the operation of the network over a test window and fires off an alarm whenever a deviation is detected. This novel detection method consistently and significantly outperforms the state of the art with respect to the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, thus establishing a new performance bar for this task, while being substantially more efficient in time and space complexities.",0
Continuized Acceleration for Quasar Convex Functions  in Non-Convex Optimization,"Quasar convexity is a condition that allows some first-order methods to efficiently minimize a function even when the optimization landscape is non-convex. Previous works develop near-optimal accelerated algorithms for minimizing this class of functions, however, they require a subroutine of binary search which results in multiple calls to gradient evaluations in each iteration, and consequently the total number of gradient evaluations does not match a known lower bound. In this work, we show that a recently proposed continuized Nesterov acceleration can be applied to minimizing quasar convex functions and achieves the optimal bound with a high probability. Furthermore, we find that the objective functions of training generalized linear models (GLMs) satisfy quasar convexity, which broadens the applicability of the relevant algorithms, while known practical examples of quasar convexity in non-convex learning are sparse in the literature. We also show that if a smooth and one-point strongly convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, or quadratic-growth function satisfies quasar convexity, then attaining an accelerated linear rate for minimizing the function is possible under certain conditions, while acceleration is not known in general for these classes of functions.

Light Sampling Field and BRDF Representation for Physically-based Neural Rendering,"Physically-based rendering (PBR) is key for immersive rendering effects used widely in the industry to showcase detailed realistic scenes from computer graphics assets. A well-known caveat is that producing the same is computationally heavy and relies on complex capture devices. Inspired by the success in quality and efficiency of recent volumetric neural rendering, we want to develop a physically-based neural shader to eliminate device dependency and significantly boost performance. However, no existing lighting and material models in the current neural rendering approaches can accurately represent the comprehensive lighting models and BRDFs properties required by the PBR process. Thus, this paper proposes a novel lighting representation that models direct and indirect light locally through a light sampling strategy in a learned light sampling field. We also propose BRDF models to separately represent surface/subsurface scattering details to enable complex objects such as translucent material (i.e., skin, jade). We then implement our proposed representations with an end-to-end physically-based neural face skin shader, which takes a standard face asset (i.e., geometry, albedo map, and normal map) and an HDRI for illumination as inputs and generates a photo-realistic rendering as output. Extensive experiments showcase the quality and efficiency of our PBR face skin shader, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed lighting and material representations. ",1
Conformal Prediction is Robust to Label Noise,"We study the robustness of conformal prediction—a powerful tool for uncertainty quantification—to label noise. Our analysis tackles both regression and classification problems, characterizing when and how it is possible to construct uncertainty sets that correctly cover the unobserved noiseless ground truth labels. Through stylized theoretical examples and practical experiments, we argue that naïve conformal prediction covers the noiseless ground truth label unless the noise distribution is adversarially designed. This leads us to believe that correcting for label noise is unnecessary except for pathological data distributions or noise sources. In such cases, we can also correct for noise of bounded size in the conformal prediction algorithm in order to ensure correct coverage of the ground truth labels without score or data regularity.",0
Simple initialization and parametrization of sinusoidal networks via their kernel bandwidth,"Neural networks with sinusoidal activations have been proposed as an alternative to networks with traditional activation functions. Despite their promise, particularly for learning implicit models, their training behavior is not yet fully understood, leading to a number of empirical design choices that are not well justified. In this work, we first propose a simplified version of such sinusoidal neural networks, which allows both for easier practical implementation and simpler theoretical analysis. We then analyze the behavior of these networks from the neural tangent kernel perspective and demonstrate that their kernel approximates a low-pass filter with an adjustable bandwidth. Finally, we utilize these insights to inform the sinusoidal network initialization, optimizing their performance for each of a series of tasks, including learning implicit models and solving differential equations.",1
Temporal Dynamics Aware Adversarial Attacks On Discrete-Time Graph Models,"Real-world graphs such as social networks, communication networks, and rating networks are constantly evolving over time. Many architectures have been developed to learn effective node representations using both graph structure and its dynamics. While the robustness of static graph models is well-studied, the vulnerability of the dynamic graph models to adversarial attacks is underexplored. In this work, we design a novel adversarial attack on discrete-time dynamic graph models where we desire to perturb the input graph sequence in a manner that preserves the temporal dynamics of the graph. To this end, we motivate a novel Temporal Dynamics-Aware Perturbation (TDAP) constraint, which ensures that perturbations introduced at each time step are restricted to only a small fraction of the number of changes in the graph since the previous time step. We present a theoretically-grounded Projected Gradient Descent approach for dynamic graphs to find the effective perturbations under the TDAP constraint. Experiments on two tasks — dynamic link prediction and node classification, show that our approach is up to 4x more effective than the baseline methods for attacking these models. We also consider the practical online setting where graph snapshots become available in real-time and extend our attack approach to use Online Gradient Descent for performing attacks under the TDAP constraint. In this more challenging setting, we demonstrate that our method achieves upto 5x superior performance when compared to representative baselines.",0
Accurate Neural Training with 4-bit Matrix Multiplications at Standard Formats,"Quantization of the weights and activations is one of the main methods to reduce the computational footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training. Current methods enable 4-bit quantization of the forward phase. However, this constitutes only a third of the training process. Reducing the computational footprint of the entire training process requires the quantization of the neural gradients, i.e., the loss gradients with respect to the outputs of intermediate neural layers. 

Previous works separately showed that accurate 4-bit quantization of the neural gradients needs to (1) be unbiased and (2) have a log scale. However, no previous work aimed to combine both ideas, as we do in this work. Specifically, we examine the importance of having unbiased quantization in quantized neural network training, where to maintain it, and how to combine it with logarithmic quantization. Based on this, we suggest a $\textit{logarithmic unbiased quantization}$ (LUQ) method to quantize all both the forward and backward phase to 4-bit, achieving state-of-the-art results in 4-bit training without overhead. For example, in ResNet50 on ImageNet, we achieved a degradation of 1.1 %. We further improve this to degradation of only 0.32 % after three epochs of high precision fine-tunining, combined with a variance reduction method---where both these methods add overhead comparable to previously suggested methods.

Quantum Fourier Networks for solving Parametric PDEs,"Many real-world problems like modelling environment dynamics, physical processes, time series etc., involve solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) parameterized by problem-specific conditions. Recently, a deep learning architecture called Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) proved to be capable of learning solutions of given PDE families, for any initial conditions as input. Given the advancements in quantum hardware and the recent results in quantum machine learning methods, we propose three quantum circuits, inspired by the FNO, to learn this functional mapping for PDEs. The proposed algorithms are distinguished based on the trade-off between depth and their similarity to the classical FNO. At their core, we make use of unary encoding paradigm and orthogonal quantum layers, and introduce a new quantum Fourier transform in the unary basis. With respect to the number of samples, our quantum algorithm is proven to be substantially faster than the classical counterpart. We benchmark our proposed algorithms on three PDE families, namely Burger’s equation, Darcy’s flow equation and the Navier-Stokes equation, and the results show that our quantum methods are comparable in performance to the classical FNO. We also show an analysis of the image classification tasks where our proposed algorithms are able to match the accuracy of the CNNs, thereby showing their applicability to other domains.",0
Learning Harmonic Molecular Representations on Riemannian Manifold,"Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in AI-assisted drug discovery research. Encoding 3D molecular structures through Euclidean neural networks has become the prevailing method in the geometric deep learning community. However, the equivariance constraints and message passing in Euclidean space may limit the network expressive power. In this work, we propose a Harmonic Molecular Representation learning (HMR) framework, which represents a molecule using the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of the molecular surface. HMR offers a multi-resolution representation of molecular geometric and chemical properties on 2D Riemannian manifold. We also introduce a harmonic message passing method to realize efficient spectral message passing over the surface manifold for better molecular encoding. Our proposed method shows comparable predictive power to current models in small molecule property prediction, and outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning models for the rigid protein docking challenge, demonstrating its versatility in molecular representation learning.",1
Accelerated Training via Principled Methods for Incrementally Growing Neural Networks,"We develop an approach to efficiently grow neural networks, within which parameterization and optimization strategies are designed by considering their effects on the training dynamics.  Unlike existing growing methods, which follow simple replication heuristics or utilize auxiliary gradient-based local optimization, we craft a parameterization scheme which dynamically stabilizes weight, activation, and gradient scaling as the architecture evolves, and maintains the inference functionality of the network.  To address the optimization difficulty resulting from imbalanced training effort distributed to subnetworks fading in at different growth phases, we propose a learning rate adaption mechanism that rebalances the gradient contribution of these separate subcomponents.  Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable or better accuracy than training large fixed-size models, while saving a substantial portion of the original computation budget for training.  We demonstrate that these gains translate into real wall-clock training speedups.",0
Landscape Learning for Neural Network Inversion,"Many machine learning methods operate by inverting a neural network at inference time, which has become a popular technique for solving inverse problems in computer vision, robotics, and graphics. However, these methods often involve gradient descent through a highly non-convex loss landscape, causing the optimization process to be unstable and slow. We introduce a method that learns a loss landscape where gradient descent is efficient, bringing massive improvement and acceleration to the inversion process. We demonstrate this advantage on a number of methods for both generative and discriminative tasks, including GAN inversion, adversarial defense, and 3D human pose reconstruction.",0
Rethinking skip connection model as a learnable Markov chain,"Over the past few years afterward the birth of ResNet, skip connection has become the defacto standard for the design of modern architectures due to its widespread adoption, easy optimization, and proven performance.
Prior work has explained the effectiveness of the skip connection mechanism from different perspectives.
In this work, we deep dive into the model's behaviors with skip connections which can be formulated as a learnable Markov chain.
An efficient Markov chain is preferred as it always maps the input data to the target domain in a better way.
However, while a model is explained as a Markov chain, it is not guaranteed to be optimized following an efficient Markov chain by existing SGD-based optimizers prone to getting trapped in local optimal points.
In order to move towards a more efficient Markov chain, we propose a simple routine of penal connection to make any residual-like model become a learnable Markov chain.
Aside from that, the penal connection can also be viewed as a particular model regularization and can be easily implemented with one line of code in the most popular deep learning frameworks. 
The encouraging experimental results in multi-modal translation and image recognition empirically confirm our conjecture of the learnable Markov chain view and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed penal connection.",1
Robustness Evaluation Using Local Substitute Networks,"Robustness of a neural network against adversarial examples is an important topic when a deep classifier is applied in safety critical use cases like health care or autonomous driving. In order to assess the robustness, practitioners use a range of different tools ranging from the adversarial attacks to exact computation of the distance to the decision boundary. We use the fact that robustness of a neural network is a local property and empirically show that computing the same metrics for the smaller local substitute networks yields good estimates of the robustness for lower cost. To construct the substitute network we develop two pruning techniques that preserve the local properties of the initial network around a given anchor point. Our experiments on CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets prove that this approach saves a significant amount of computing time and is especially beneficial for the larger models.",0
Removing Structured Noise with Diffusion Models,"Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires careful formulation of prior beliefs over the signals of interest and an accurate description of their manifestation into noisy measurements. Handcrafted signal priors based on e.g. sparsity are increasingly replaced by data-driven deep generative models, and several groups have recently shown that state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models yield particularly strong performance and flexibility. In this paper, we show that the powerful paradigm of posterior sampling with diffusion models can be extended to include rich, structured, noise models. To that end, we propose a joint conditional reverse diffusion process with learned scores for the noise and signal-generating distribution. We demonstrate strong performance gains across various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming competitive baselines that use normalizing flows and adversarial networks. This opens up new opportunities and relevant practical applications of diffusion modeling for inverse problems in the context of non-Gaussian measurements.",0
Constructive TT-representation of the tensors given as index interaction functions with applications,"This paper presents a method to build explicit tensor-train (TT) representations. We show that a wide class of tensors can be explicitly represented with sparse TT-cores, obtaining, in many cases, optimal TT-ranks. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms the existing ones in several practical applications, including game theory problems. Theoretical estimations of the number of operations show that in some problems, such as permanent calculation, our methods are close to the known optimal asymptotics, which are obtained by a completely different type of methods.",1
Adversarial Detector for Decision Tree Ensembles Using Representation Learning,"Research on adversarial evasion attacks focuses mainly on neural network models. Among other reasons, this is because of their popularity in certain fields (e.g., computer vision and NLP) and the models' properties, making it easier to search for adversarial examples with minimal input change. Decision trees and tree ensembles are still very popular due to their high
performance in fields dominated by tabular data and their explainability. In recent years, several works have defined new adversarial attacks targeting decision trees and tree ensembles. As a result, several papers were published focusing on robust versions of tree ensembles. This research aims to create an adversarial detector for attacks on an ensemble of decision trees. While several previous works have demonstrated the generation of more robust tree ensembles, the process of considering evasion attacks during ensemble generation can affect model performance. We demonstrate a method to detect adversarial samples without affecting either the target model structure or its original performance. We showed that by using representation learning based on the structure of the trees, we achieved better detection rates than the state-of-the-art technique and better than using the original representation of the dataset to train an adversarial detector.",0
'I pick you choose': Joint human-algorithm decision making in multi-armed bandits,"Online learning in multi-armed bandits has been a rich area of research for decades, resulting in numerous \enquote{no-regret} algorithms that efficiently learn the arm with highest expected reward. However, in many settings the final decision of which arm to pull isn't under the control of the algorithm itself. For example, a driving app typically suggests a subset of routes (arms) to the driver, who ultimately makes the final choice about which to select. Typically, the human also wishes to learn the optimal arm based on historical reward information, but decides which arm to pull based on a potentially different objective function, such as being more or less myopic about exploiting near-term rewards. In this paper, we show when this joint human-algorithm system can achieve good performance. Specifically, we explore multiple possible frameworks for human objectives and give theoretical regret bounds for regret. Finally, we include experimental results exploring how regret varies with the human decision-maker's objective, as well as the number of arms presented. ",0
Leveraging Large Language Models for Multiple Choice Question Answering,"While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have achieved impressive results on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in the zero, one, and few-shot settings, they generally lag behind the MCQA state of the art (SOTA). MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks. An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., “A”) associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective, the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been previously underestimated.",1
Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes,"Neural Processes (NPs) are popular methods in meta-learning that can estimate predictive uncertainty on target datapoints by conditioning on a context dataset. Previous state-of-the-art method Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs) achieve strong performance but require quadratic computation with respect to the number of context datapoints, significantly limiting its scalability. Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANPs), a new computationally efficient sub-quadratic NP variant, that has a querying computational complexity independent of the number of context datapoints. The model encodes the context dataset into a constant number of latent vectors on which self-attention is performed. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the latent vectors. We empirically show that LBANPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art on meta-regression, image completion, and contextual multi-armed bandits. We demonstrate that LBANPs can trade-off the computational cost and performance according to the number of latent vectors. Finally, we show LBANPs can scale beyond existing attention-based NP variants to larger dataset settings.",1
Sparsity-Constrained Optimal Transport,"Regularized optimal transport (OT) is now increasingly used as a loss or as a matching layer in neural networks. Entropy-regularized OT can be computed using the Sinkhorn algorithm but it leads to fully-dense transportation plans, meaning that all sources are (fractionally) matched with all targets. To address this issue, several works have investigated quadratic regularization instead. This regularization preserves sparsity and leads to unconstrained and smooth (semi) dual objectives, that can be solved with off-the-shelf gradient methods. Unfortunately, quadratic regularization does not give direct control over the cardinality (number of nonzeros) of the transportation plan. We propose in this paper a new approach for OT with explicit cardinality constraints on the transportation plan. Our work is motivated by an application to sparse mixture of experts, where OT can be used to match input tokens such as image patches with expert models such as neural networks. Cardinality constraints ensure that at most $k$ tokens are matched with an expert, which is crucial for computational performance reasons. Despite the nonconvexity of cardinality constraints, we show that the corresponding (semi) dual problems are tractable and can be solved with first-order gradient methods. Our method can be thought as a middle ground between unregularized OT (recovered in the limit case $k=1$) and quadratically-regularized OT (recovered when $k$ is large enough). The smoothness of the objectives increases as $k$ increases, giving rise to a trade-off between convergence speed and sparsity of the optimal plan.",1
Evaluating Long-Term Memory in 3D Mazes,"Intelligent agents need to remember salient information to reason in partially-observed environments. For example, agents with a first-person view should remember the positions of relevant objects even if they go out of view. Similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the floor plan of how rooms are connected. However, most benchmark tasks in reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down progress in this important research direction. In this paper, we introduce the Memory Maze, a 3D domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for evaluating long-term memory in agents. Unlike existing benchmarks, Memory Maze measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time. With Memory Maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. Recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode. We find that current algorithms benefit from training with truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the Memory Maze.",1
Graph-based Deterministic Policy Gradient for Repetitive Combinatorial Optimization Problems,"We propose an actor-critic framework for graph-based machine learning pipelines with non-differentiable blocks, and apply it to repetitive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) under hard constraints. Repetitive COP refers to problems to be solved repeatedly on graphs of the same or slowly changing topology but rapidly changing node or edge weights. Compared to one-shot COPs, repetitive COPs often rely on fast heuristics to solve one instance of the problem before the next one arrives, at the cost of a relatively large optimality gap. Through numerical experiments on several discrete optimization problems, we show that our approach can learn reusable node or edge representations to reduce the optimality gap of fast heuristics for independent repetitive COPs, and can optimize the long-term objectives for repetitive COPs embedded in graph-based Markov decision processes.

Scalable and Privacy-enhanced Graph Generative Model for Graph Neural Networks,"As the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) continues to grow, it experiences a corresponding increase in the need for large, real-world datasets to train and test new GNN models on challenging, realistic problems. Unfortunately, such graph datasets are often generated from online, highly privacy-restricted ecosystems, which makes research and development on these datasets hard, if not impossible. This greatly reduces the amount of benchmark graphs available to researchers, causing the field to rely only on a handful of publicly-available datasets. To address this dilemma, we introduce a novel graph generative model, Computation Graph Transformer (CGT) that can learn and reproduce the distribution of real-world graphs in a privacy-enhanced way. Our proposed model (1) generates effective benchmark graphs on which GNNs show similar task performance as on the source graphs, (2) scales to process large-scale real-world graphs, (3) guarantees privacy for end-users. Extensive experiments across a vast body of graph generative models show that only our model can successfully generate privacy-controlled, synthetic substitutes of large-scale real-world graphs that can be effectively used to evaluate GNN models.",0
Projective Proximal Gradient Descent for Nonconvex Nonsmooth Optimization: Fast Convergence Without Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) Property,"Nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems are important and challenging for statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose Projected Proximal Gradient Descent (PPGD) which solves a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, where the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness come from a nonsmooth regularization term which is nonconvex but piecewise convex. In contrast with existing convergence analysis of accelerated PGD methods for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems based on the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (K\L{}) property, we provide a new theoretical analysis showing local fast convergence of PPGD. It is proved that PPGD achieves a fast convergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$ when the iteration number $k \ge k_0$ for a finite $k_0$ on a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems under mild assumptions, which is locally the Nesterov's optimal convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPGD.",1
Deep Graph-Level Orthogonal Hypersphere Compression for Anomaly Detection,"Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal samples of a set of graphs in an unsupervised manner. It is non-trivial to find a reasonable decision boundary between normal data and anomalous data without using any anomalous data in the training stage, especially for data in graphs. This paper first proposes a novel deep graph-level anomaly detection model, which learns the graph representation with maximum mutual information between substructure features and global structure features while exploring a hypersphere anomaly decision boundary. The deep orthogonal projection layer is adopted to keep the training data distribution consistent with the decision hypersphere thus avoiding erroneous evaluations. We further propose projecting the normal data into the interval region between two co-centered hyperspheres, which makes the normal data distribution more compact and effectively overcomes the issue of outliers falling close to the center of the hypersphere. The numerical and visualization results on a few graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods in comparison to many baselines and state-of-the-art.",0
Specialization of Sub-paths for Adaptive Depth Networks,"We present a novel approach to anytime networks that can control network depths instantly at runtime to provide various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. While controlling the depth of a network is an effective way to obtain actual inference speed-up, previous adaptive depth networks require either additional intermediate classifiers or decision networks, that are challenging to train properly. Unlike previous approaches, our adaptive depth networks require virtually no architectural changes from baseline networks. Instead, we introduce a novel training method that enforces some sub-paths of the baseline networks to have a special property, with which the sub-paths do not change the semantic level of input features, but only refine them to reduce prediction errors. Those specialized sub-paths can be skipped at test time, if needed, to save computation at marginal loss of prediction accuracy. We first formally present the rationale behind the sub-paths specialization, and based on that, we propose a simple and practical training method to specialize sub-paths for adaptive depth networks. While minimal architectural changes and training efforts are required, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive baselines in various tasks, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and instance segmentation. Further, we show that the smallest sub-networks of our adaptive depth networks achieve competitive model compression effect compared to recent state-of-the-art techniques.",0
AlphaDesign: A graph protein design method and benchmark on AlphaFold DB,"While AlphaFold has remarkably advanced protein folding, the inverse problem, protein design, by which protein sequences are predicted from the corresponding 3D structures, still faces significant challenges. First of all, there lacks a large-scale benchmark covering the vast protein space for evaluating methods and models; secondly, existing methods are still low in prediction accuracy and time-inefficient inference. This paper establishes a new benchmark based on AlphaFold DB, one of the world's largest protein structure databases. Moreover, we propose a new baseline method called AlphaDesign, which achieves 5\% higher recovery than previous methods and about 70 times inference speed-up in designing long protein sequences. We also reveal AlphaDesign's potential for practical protein design tasks, where the designed proteins achieve good structural compatibility with native structures. The open-source code will be released. ",0
Restricted Generative Projection for One-Class Classification and Anomaly detection,"We present a novel framework for one-class classification and anomaly detection. The core idea is to learn a mapping to transform the unknown distribution of training (normal) data to a known distribution that is supposed to be different from the transformed distribution of unknown abnormal data. Crucially, the target distribution of training data should be sufficiently simple, compact, and informative. The simplicity is to ensure that we can sample from the distribution easily, the compactness is to ensure that the decision boundary between normal data and abnormal data is clear and reliable, and the informativeness is to ensure that the transformed data preserve the important information of the original data. Therefore, we propose to use truncated Gaussian, uniform in hyperball, uniform on hypersphere, or uniform between hyperspheres, as the target distribution.  We then minimize the distance between the transformed data distribution and the target distribution while keeping the reconstruction error for the original data small enough. Our model is simple and easy to train especially compared with those based on generative models. Comparative studies on a few benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method in comparison to baselines.",0
CFlowNets: Continuous Control with Generative Flow Networks,"Generative flow networks (GFlowNets), as an emerging technique, can be used as an alternative to reinforcement learning for exploratory control tasks. GFlowNets aims to sample actions with a probability proportional to the reward, similar to sampling different candidates in an active learning fashion. However, existing GFlowNets cannot adapt to continuous control tasks because GFlowNets need to form a DAG and compute the flow matching loss by traversing the inflows and outflows of each node in the trajectory. In this paper, we propose generative continuous flow networks (CFlowNets) that can be applied to continuous control tasks. First, we present the theoretical formulation of CFlowNets. Then, a training framework for CFlowNets is proposed, including the action selection process, the flow approximation algorithm, and the continuous flow matching loss function. Afterward, we theoretically prove the error bound of the flow approximation. The error decreases rapidly as the number of flow samples increases. Finally, experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate the performance advantages of CFlowNets compared to many reinforcement learning methods, especially regarding exploration ability.",1
AutoTransfer: AutoML with Knowledge Transfer - An Application to Graph Neural Networks,"AutoML has demonstrated remarkable success in finding an effective neural architecture for a given machine learning task defined by a specific dataset and an evaluation metric. However, most present AutoML techniques consider each task independently from scratch, which requires exploring many architectures, leading to high computational cost. Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the prior architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key innovation includes a task-model bank that captures the model performance over a diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks, and a computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity among different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating a similarity-weighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently, and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude. Finally, we release GNN-Bank-101, a large-scale dataset of detailed GNN training information of 120,000 task-model combinations to facilitate and inspire future research.",1
Language Model Pre-training with Linguistically Motivated Curriculum Learning,"Pre-training serves as a foundation of recent NLP models, where language modeling task is performed over large texts. It has been shown that data affects the quality of pre-training, and curriculum has been investigated regarding sequence length. We consider a linguistic perspective in the curriculum, where frequent words are learned first and rare words last. This is achieved by substituting syntactic constituents for rare words with their constituent labels. By such syntactic substitutions, a curriculum can be made by gradually introducing words with decreasing frequency levels. Without modifying model architectures or introducing external computational overhead, our data-centric method gives better performances over vanilla BERT on various downstream benchmarks.",0
Neural Collapse Inspired Feature-Classifier Alignment for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,"Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) has been a challenging problem as only a few training samples are accessible for each novel class in the new sessions. Finetuning the backbone or adjusting the classifier prototypes trained in the prior sessions would inevitably cause a misalignment between the feature and classifier of old classes, which explains the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment dilemma in FSCIL inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon named neural collapse, which reveals that the last-layer features of the same class will collapse into a vertex, and the vertices of all classes are aligned with the classifier prototypes, which are formed as a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). It corresponds to an optimal geometric structure for classification due to the maximized Fisher Discriminant Ratio. We propose a neural collapse inspired framework for FSCIL. A group of classifier prototypes are pre-assigned as a simplex ETF for the whole label space, including the base session and all the incremental sessions. During training, the classifier prototypes are not learnable, and we adopt a novel loss function that drives the features into their corresponding prototypes. Theoretical analysis shows that our method holds the neural collapse optimality and does not break the feature-classifier alignment in an incremental fashion. Experiments on the miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.

Data augmentation alone can improve adversarial training,"Adversarial training suffers from the issue of robust overfitting, which seriously impairs its generalization performance. Data augmentation, which is effective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by many previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial training. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general, diversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost robustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both over that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop transformation Cropshift with improved  diversity compared to the conventional one (Padcrop). We then propose a new data augmentation scheme, based on Cropshift, with much improved diversity and well-balanced hardness. Empirically, our augmentation method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness for data augmentations in adversarial training. Furthermore, it matches, or even exceeds when combined with weight averaging, the performance of the best contemporary regularization methods for alleviating robust overfitting.",1
Unsupervised Non-Parametric Signal Separation Using Bayesian Neural Networks,"Bayesian neural networks (BNN) take the best from two worlds: the one of flexible and scalable neural networks and the one of probabilistic graphical models, the latter allowing for probabilistic interpretation of inference results. 
We make one extra step towards unification of these two domains and render BNN as an elementary unit of abstraction in the framework of probabilistic modeling, which allows us to promote well-known distributions to distribution fields. 
We use transformations to obtain field versions of several popular distributions and demonstrate the utility of our approach on the problem of signal/background separation.
Starting from prior knowledge that a certain region of space contains predominantly one of the components, in an unsupervised and non-parametric manner, we recover the representation of both previously unseen components as well as their proportions.",0
Pushing the Limits of Fewshot Anomaly Detection in Industry Vision: Graphcore,"In the area of few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD), efficient visual feature plays an essential role in the memory bank $\mathcal{M}$-based methods. However, these methods do not account for the relationship between the visual feature and its rotated visual feature, drastically limiting the anomaly detection performance. To push the limits, we reveal that rotation-invariant feature property has a significant impact on industrial-based FSAD. Specifically, we utilize graph representation in FSAD and provide a novel visual isometric invariant feature (VIIF) as an anomaly measurement feature. As a result, VIIF can robustly improve the anomaly discriminating ability and can further reduce the size of redundant features stored in $\mathcal{M}$ by a large amount. Besides, we provide a novel model GraphCore via VIIFs that can fast implement unsupervised FSAD training and improve the performance of anomaly detection. A comprehensive evaluation is provided for comparing GraphCore and other SOTA anomaly detection models under our proposed few-shot anomaly detection setting, which shows GraphCore can increase average AUC by 5.8%, 4.1%, 3.4%, and 1.6% on MVTec AD and by 25.5%, 22.0%, 16.9%, and 14.1% on MPDD for 1, 2, 4, and 8-shot cases, respectively.",1
A Self-Attention Ansatz for Ab-initio Quantum Chemistry,"We present a novel neural network architecture using self-attention, the Wavefunction Transformer (PsiFormer), which can be used as an approximation (or ""Ansatz"") for solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, the fundamental equation for quantum chemistry and material science. This equation can be solved *from first principles*, requiring no external training data. In recent years, deep neural networks like the FermiNet and PauliNet have been used to significantly improve the accuracy of these first-principle calculations, but they lack an attention-like mechanism for gating interactions between electrons. Here we show that the PsiFormer can be used as a drop-in replacement for these other neural networks, often dramatically improving the accuracy of the calculations. On larger molecules especially, the ground state energy can be improved by dozens of kcal/mol, a qualitative leap over previous methods. This demonstrates that self-attention networks can learn complex quantum mechanical correlations between electrons, and are a promising route to reaching unprecedented accuracy in chemical calculations on larger systems.",1
The Implicit Bias of Minima Stability in Multivariate Shallow ReLU Networks,"We study the type of solutions to which stochastic gradient descent converges when used to train a single hidden-layer multivariate ReLU network with the quadratic loss. Our results are based on a dynamical stability analysis. In the univariate case, it was shown that linearly stable minima correspond to network functions (predictors), whose second derivative has a bounded weighted $L^1$ norm. Notably, the bound gets smaller as the step size increases, implying that training with a large step size leads to `smoother' predictors. Here we generalize this result to the multivariate case, showing that a similar result applies to the Laplacian of the predictor. We demonstrate the tightness of our bound on the MNIST dataset, and show that it accurately captures the behavior of the solutions as a function of the step size. Additionally, we prove a depth separation result on the approximation power of ReLU networks corresponding to stable minima of the loss. Specifically, although shallow ReLU networks are universal approximators, we prove that stable shallow networks are not. Namely, there is a function that cannot be well-approximated by stable single hidden-layer ReLU networks trained with a non-vanishing step size. This is while the same function can be realized as a stable two hidden-layer ReLU network. Finally, we prove that if a function is sufficiently smooth (in a Sobolev sense) then it can be approximated arbitrarily well using shallow ReLU networks that correspond to stable solutions of gradient descent.",1
Towards Efficient Gradient-Based Meta-Learning in Heterogenous Environments,"A challenging problem for machine learning is few-shot learning, as its models usually require many training samples. Since meta-learning models have strong fine-tuning capabilities for the distribution of tasks, many of them have been applied to few-shot learning. Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most popular ones. Recent studies showed that MAML-trained models tend to reuse learned features and do not perform strong adaption, especially in the earlier layers. This paper presents an in-detail analysis of this phenomenon by analyzing MAML's components of different variants. Our results show an interesting relationship between the importance of fine-tuning earlier layers and the difference in the distribution between training and testing. As a result, we determine a fundamental weakness of existing MAML variants when the task distribution is heterogeneous, e.g., the numbers of classes do not match during testing and training. We propose a novel nonparametric version of MAML that overcomes these issues while still being able to perform cross-domain adaption.",0
Bispectral Neural Networks,"We present a neural network architecture, Bispectral Neural Networks (BNNs) for learning representations that are invariant to the actions of compact commutative groups on the space over which a signal is defined. The model incorporates the ansatz of the bispectrum, an analytically defined group invariant that is complete -- that is, it preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Here, we demonstrate that BNNs are able to simultaneously learn groups, their irreducible representations, and corresponding equivariant and complete-invariant maps purely from the symmetries implicit in data.  Further, we demonstrate that the completeness property endows these networks with strong invariance-based adversarial robustness. This work establishes Bispectral Neural Networks as a powerful computational primitive for robust invariant representation learning.",1
Symmetrical SyncMap for Imbalanced General Chunking Problems,"Recently, SyncMap (2021) pioneered an approach to learn complex structures from sequences as well as adapt to any changes in underlying structures. Such approach, inspired by neuron group behaviors, is achieved by using self-organizing dynamical equations without any loss functions. Here we propose Symmetrical SyncMap that goes beyond the original work to show how to create dynamical equations and attractor-repeller points which are stable over the long run, even dealing with imbalanced continual general chunking problems (CGCPs). The main idea is to apply equal updates from positive and negative feedback loops by symmetrical activation. We then introduce the concept of memory window to allow for more positive updates. Our algorithm surpasses or ties other unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines in all 12 imbalanced CGCPs with various difficulties, including dynamical ones. To verify its performance in real-world scenarios, we conduct experiments on several well-studied structure learning problems. The proposed method surpasses substantially other methods in all scenarios, suggesting that symmetrical activation plays a critical role in uncovering topological structures and even hierarchies encoded in temporal data.",0
BrainBERT: Self-supervised representation learning for intracranial recordings,"We create a reusable Transformer, BrainBERT, for intracranial recordings bringing modern representation learning approaches to neuroscience. Much like in NLP and speech recognition, this Transformer enables classifying complex concepts, i.e., decoding neural data, with higher accuracy and with much less data by being pretrained in an unsupervised manner on a large corpus of unannotated neural recordings. Our approach generalizes to new subjects with electrodes in new positions and to unrelated tasks showing that the representations robustly disentangle the neural signal. Just like in NLP where one can study language by investigating what a language model learns, this approach opens the door to investigating the brain by what a model of the brain learns. As a first step along this path, we demonstrate a new analysis of the intrinsic dimensionality of the computations in different areas of the brain. To construct these representations, we combine a technique for producing super-resolution spectrograms of neural data with an approach designed for generating contextual representations of audio by masking. In the future, far more concepts will be decodable from neural recordings by using representation learning, potentially unlocking the brain like language models unlocked language.  ",1
Reward Learning with Trees: Methods and Evaluation,"Recent efforts to learn reward functions from human feedback have tended to use deep neural networks, whose lack of transparency hampers our ability to explain agent behaviour or verify alignment. We explore the merits of learning intrinsically interpretable tree models instead. We develop a recently proposed method for learning reward trees from preference labels, and show it to be broadly competitive with neural networks on challenging high-dimensional tasks, with good robustness to limited or corrupted data. Having found that reward tree learning can be done effectively in complex settings, we then consider why it should be used, demonstrating that the interpretable reward structure gives significant scope for traceability, verification and explanation.",0
ExpressivE: A Spatio-Functional Embedding For Knowledge Graph Completion,"Knowledge graphs are inherently incomplete. Therefore substantial research has been directed toward knowledge graph completion (KGC), i.e., predicting missing triples from the information represented in the knowledge graph (KG). KG embedding models (KGEs) have yielded promising results for KGC, yet any current KGE is incapable of: (1) fully capturing vital inference patterns (e.g., composition), (2) capturing prominent patterns jointly (e.g., hierarchy and composition), and (3) providing an intuitive interpretation of captured patterns. In this work, we propose ExpressivE, a fully expressive spatio-functional KGE that solves all these challenges simultaneously. ExpressivE embeds pairs of entities as points and relations as hyper-parallelograms in the virtual triple space $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. This model design allows ExpressivE not only to capture a rich set of inference patterns jointly but additionally to display any supported inference pattern through the spatial relation of hyper-parallelograms, offering an intuitive and consistent geometric interpretation of ExpressivE embeddings and their captured patterns. Experimental results on standard KGC benchmarks reveal that ExpressivE is competitive with state-of-the-art KGEs and even significantly outperforms them on WN18RR.",1
Memory-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Priority based on Surprise and On-policyness,"In off-policy reinforcement learning, an agent collects transition data (a.k.a. experience tuples) from the environment and stores them in a replay buffer for the incoming parameter updates. Storing those tuples consumes a large amount of memory when the environment observations are given as images. Large memory consumption is especially problematic when reinforcement learning methods are applied in scenarios where the computational resources are limited. In this paper, we introduce a method to prune relatively unimportant experience tuples by a simple metric that estimates the importance of experiences and saves the overall memory consumption by the buffer. To measure the importance of experiences, we use $\textit{surprise}$ and $\textit{on-policyness}$. Surprise is quantified by the information gain the model can obtain from the experiences and on-policyness ensures that they are relevant to the current policy. In our experiments, we empirically show that our method can significantly reduce the memory consumption by the replay buffer without decreasing the performance in vision-based environments.",0
VA-DepthNet: A Variational Approach to Single Image Depth Prediction,"We introduce VA-DepthNet, a simple, effective, and accurate deep neural network approach for the single-image depth prediction (SIDP) problem. The proposed approach advocates using classical first-order variational constraints for this problem. While state-of-the-art deep neural network methods for SIDP learn the scene depth from images in a supervised setting, they often overlook the invaluable invariances and priors in the rigid scene space, such as the regularity of the scene. The paper's main contribution is to reveal the benefit of classical and well-founded variational constraints in the neural network design for the SIDP task. It is shown that imposing first-order variational constraints in the scene space together with popular encoder-decoder-based network architecture design provides excellent results for the supervised SIDP task. The imposed first-order variational constraint makes the network aware of the depth gradient in the scene space, i.e., regularity. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach via extensive evaluation and ablation analysis over several benchmark datasets, such as KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and SUN RGB-D. The VA-DepthNet at test time shows considerable improvements in depth prediction accuracy compared to the prior art and is accurate also at high-frequency regions in the scene space.  At the time of writing this paper, our method---labeled as VA-DepthNet, when tested on the KITTI depth-prediction evaluation set benchmarks, shows state-of-the-art results, and is the top-performing published approach.",1
Representational Dissimilarity Metric Spaces for Stochastic Neural Networks,"Quantifying similarity between neural representations---e.g. hidden layer activation vectors---is a perennial problem in deep learning and neuroscience research. Existing methods compare deterministic responses (e.g. artificial networks that lack stochastic layers) or averaged responses (e.g., trial-averaged firing rates in biological data). However, these measures of _deterministic_ representational similarity ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, both of which play important roles in neural computation. To rectify this, we generalize previously proposed shape metrics (Williams et al. 2021) to quantify differences in _stochastic_ representations. These new distances satisfy the triangle inequality, and thus can be used as a rigorous basis for many supervised and unsupervised analyses. Leveraging this novel framework, we find that the stochastic geometries of neurobiological representations of oriented visual gratings and naturalistic scenes respectively resemble untrained and trained deep network representations. Further, we are able to more accurately predict certain network attributes (e.g. training hyperparameters) from its position in stochastic (versus deterministic) shape space.",1
Open-domain Visual Entity Linking,"We introduce the task of Open-domain Visual Entity Linking (OVEN), targeting a wide range of entities including animals, plants, buildings, locations and much more. Given an image (e.g., an image of an aircraft), a text query (`What is the model?' or `What is the airline?'), and a multi-modal knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia),  the goal is to link to an entity  (Boeing-777 or EVA Air) out of all entities in the knowledge base. We build a benchmark dataset (OVEN-wiki), by repurposing 14 existing image classification, image retrieval, and visual QA datasets. We link all existing labels to Wikipedia entities when possible, using a state-of-the-art entity linking system and human annotators, creating a diverse and unified label space. OVEN is a rich and challenging task, which requires models to recognize and link visual content to both a small set of seen entities as well as a much larger set of unseen entities (e.g., unseen aircraft models). OVEN also requires models to generalize to previously unseen intents that may require more fine-grained reasoning (`Who manufactured the aircraft in the back?'). We build strong baselines based on state-of-the-art pre-trained models and find that current pre-trained models struggle to address the challenges posed by OVEN. We hope OVEN will inspire next-generation pre-training techniques and pave the way to future knowledge-intensive vision tasks.",0
Representation Balancing with Decomposed Patterns for Treatment Effect Estimation,"Estimating treatment effects from observational data is subject to a problem of covariate shift caused by selection bias. Recent studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by group distance minimization, that is, balancing the distribution of representations between the treated and controlled groups. The rationale behind this is that learning balanced representations while preserving the predictive power of factual outcomes is expected to generalize to counterfactual inference. Inspired by this, we propose a new approach to better capture the patterns that contribute to representation balancing and outcome prediction. Specifically, we derive a theoretical bound that naturally ties the notion of propensity confusion to representation balancing, and further transform the balancing Patterns into Decompositions of Individual propensity confusion and Group distance minimization (PDIG). Moreover, we propose to decompose proxy features into Patterns of Pre-balancing and Balancing Representations (PPBR), as it is insufficient if only balanced representations are considered in outcome prediction. Extensive experiments on simulation and benchmark data confirm not only PDIG leads to mutual reinforcement between individual propensity confusion and group distance minimization, but also PPBR brings improvement to outcome prediction, especially counterfactual inference. We believe these findings are heuristics for further investigation of what affects the generalizability of representation balancing models in counterfactual estimation.",0
Clustering and Ordering Variable-Sized Sets: The Catalog Problem,"Prediction of a varying number of ordered clusters from sets of any cardinality is a challenging task for neural networks, combining elements of set representation, clustering and learning to order. This task arises in many diverse areas, ranging from medical triage, through multi-channel signal analysis for petroleum exploration to product catalog structure prediction. This paper focuses on the latter, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent to adaptive ordered clustering, referred to further as the eponymous Catalog Problem. These include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting relational reasoning and managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress in both neural clustering and set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable model exists to-date. We develop such a modular architecture, referred to further as Neural Ordered Clusters (NOC), enhance it with a specific mechanism for learning cluster-level cardinality constraints, and provide a robust comparison of its performance in relation to alternative models. We test our method on three datasets, including synthetic catalog structures and PROCAT, a dataset of real-world catalogs consisting of over 1.5M products, achieving state-of-the-art results on a new, more challenging formulation of the underlying problem, which has not been addressed before. Additionally, we examine the network's ability to learn higher-order interactions and investigate its capacity to learn both compositional and structural rulesets.",0
Actionable Neural Representations: Grid Cells from Minimal Constraints,"To afford flexible behaviour, the brain must build internal representations that mirror the structure of variables in the external world. For example, 2D space obeys rules: the same set of actions combine in the same way everywhere (step north, then south, and you won't have moved, wherever you start). We suggest the brain must represent this consistent meaning of actions across space, as it allows you to find new short-cuts and navigate in unfamiliar settings. We term this representation an  `actionable representation'. We formulate actionable representations using group and representation theory, and show that, when combined with biological and functional constraints - non-negative firing, bounded neural activity, and precise coding - multiple modules of hexagonal grid cells are the optimal representation of 2D space. We support this claim with intuition, analytic justification, and simulations. Our analytic results normatively explain a set of surprising grid cell phenomena, and make testable predictions for future experiments. Lastly, we highlight the generality of our approach beyond just understanding 2D space. Our work characterises a new principle for understanding and designing flexible internal representations: they should be actionable, allowing animals and machines to predict the consequences of their actions, rather than just encode.",1
Set-Level Self-Supervised Learning from Noisily-Labeled Data,"Noisy labels are inevitably presented in real-world datasets due to labeling error or visual content ambiguity. Existing methods generally approach the task of noisy label learning (NLL) by either properly regularizing the model, or reweighting clean/noisy labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has been applied to pre-train deep neural networks without label supervision, downstream tasks like image classification still require clean labeled data. And, most SSL strategies are performed at the instance level, regardless of the correctness of its label. In this paper, we propose set-level self-supervised learning (SLSSL), which performs SSL at mini-batch levels with observed noisy labels. By corrupting the labels of each training mini-batch, our SLSSL enforces the model to exhibit sufficient robustness. Moreover, the proposed SLSSL can also be utilized for sample reweighting technique. As a result, the proposed learning scheme can be applied as an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm during model training. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy label data confirm the effectiveness of our framework.",0
What do Vision Transformers Learn?  A Visual Exploration,"Vision transformers (ViTs) are quickly becoming the de-facto architecture for computer vision, yet we understand very little about why they work and what they learn. While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains challenging. In this paper, we first address the obstacles to performing visualizations on ViTs. Assisted by these solutions, we observe that neurons in ViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by semantic concepts rather than visual features. We also explore the underlying differences between ViTs and CNNs, and we find that transformers detect image background features, just like their convolutional counterparts, but their predictions depend far less on high-frequency information. On the other hand, both architecture types behave similarly in the way features progress from abstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects in late layers. In addition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except the final layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last layer most likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global pooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide range of ViT variants, including DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to validate the effectiveness of our method.",0
Critical Initialization of Wide and Deep Neural Networks through Partial Jacobians: General Theory and Applications,"Deep neural networks are notorious for defying theoretical treatment. However, when the number of parameters in each layer tends to infinity the network function is a Gaussian process (GP) and quantitatively predictive description is possible. Gaussian approximation allows to formulate criteria for selecting hyperparameters, such as variances of weights and biases, as well as the learning rate. These criteria rely on the notion of criticality defined for deep neural networks. In this work we describe a new practical way to diagnose criticality. We introduce *partial Jacobians* of a network, defined as derivatives of preactivations in layer $l$ with respect to preactivations in layer $l_0\leq l$. We derive recurrence relations for the norms of partial Jacobians and utilize these relations to analyze criticality of deep fully connected neural networks with LayerNorm and/or residual connections. We derive and implement a simple and cheap numerical test that allows one to select optimal initialization for a broad class of deep neural networks. Using these tools we show quantitatively that proper stacking of the LayerNorm (applied to preactivations) and residual connections leads to an architecture that is critical for any initialization. Finally, we apply our methods to analyze the MLP-Mixer architecture and show that it is everywhere critical.",0
Oracle-oriented Robustness: Robust Image Model Evaluation with Pretrained Models as Surrogate Oracle,"Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable performances over finite datasets, yet whether the scores over the fixed benchmarks can sufficiently indicate the model’s performances in the real world is still in discussion. In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (*e.g.*, the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models’ behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model’s performance compared with a surrogate oracle. Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same causal structure the original test image represents, constrained by a surrogate oracle model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models’ robustness performances, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.",0
Toward Adversarial Training on Contextualized Language Representation,"Beyond the success story of adversarial training (AT) in the recent text domain on top of pre-trained language models (PLMs), our empirical study showcases the inconsistent gains from AT on some tasks, e.g. commonsense reasoning, named entity recognition. This paper investigates AT from the perspective of the contextualized language representation outputted by PLM encoders. We find the current AT attacks lean to generate sub-optimal adversarial examples that can fool the decoder part but have a minor effect on the encoder. However, we find it necessary to effectively deviate the latter one to allow AT to gain. Based on the observation, we propose simple yet effective \textit{Contextualized representation-Adversarial Training} (CreAT), in which the attack is explicitly optimized to deviate the contextualized representation of the encoder. It allows a global optimization of adversarial examples that can fool the entire model. We also find CreAT gives rise to a better direction to optimize the adversarial examples, to let them less sensitive to hyperparameters. Compared to AT, CreAT produces consistent performance gains on a wider range of tasks and is proven to be more effective for language pre-training where only the encoder part is kept for downstream tasks. We achieve the new state-of-the-art performances on a series of challenging benchmarks, e.g. AdvGLUE (59.1 $ \rightarrow $ 61.1), HellaSWAG (93.0  $ \rightarrow $ 94.9), ANLI (68.1  $ \rightarrow $ 69.3).",1
ROSCOE: A Suite of Metrics for Scoring Step-by-Step Reasoning,"Large language models show improved downstream task performance when prompted to generate step-by-step reasoning to justify their final answers. These reasoning steps greatly improve model interpretability and verification, but objectively studying their correctness (independent of the final answer) is difficult without reliable methods for automatic evaluation. We simply do not know how often the stated reasoning steps actually support the final end task predictions. In this work, we present ROSCOE, a suite of interpretable, unsupervised automatic scores that improve and extend previous text generation evaluation metrics. To evaluate ROSCOE against baseline metrics, we design a typology of reasoning errors and collect synthetic and human evaluation scores on commonly used reasoning datasets. In contrast with existing metrics, ROSCOE can measure semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality — among other traits — by leveraging properties of step-by-step rationales. We empirically verify the strength of our metrics on five human annotated and six programmatically perturbed diagnostics datasets - covering a diverse set of tasks that require reasoning skills and show that ROSCOE can consistently outperform baseline metrics.",1
Anamnesic Neural Differential Equations with Orthogonal Polynomial Projections,"Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) are an effective framework for learning dynamical systems from irregularly sampled time series data. These models provide a continuous-time latent representation of the underlying dynamical system where new observations at arbitrary time points can be used to update the latent representation of the dynamical system. Existing parameterizations for the dynamics functions of Neural ODEs limit the ability of the model to retain global information about the time series; specifically, a piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can result in a loss of memory on the dynamic patterns of previously observed data points. We propose PolyODE, a Neural ODE that models the latent continuous-time process as a projection onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. This formulation enforces long-range memory and preserves a global representation of the underlying dynamical system. Our construction is backed by favourable theoretical guarantees and in a series of experiments, we demonstrate that it outperforms previous works in the reconstruction of past and future data, and in downstream prediction tasks.",1
Revisiting Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks,"Current graph representation learning techniques use Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) to extract features from dataset embeddings. In this work, we examine
the quality of these embeddings and assess how changing them can affect the ac-
curacy of GNNs. We explore different embedding extraction techniques for both
images and texts; and find that the choice of embedding biases the performance
of different GNN architectures and thus the choice of embedding influences the
selection of GNNs regardless of the underlying dataset. In addition, we only see
an improvement in accuracy from some GNN models compared to the accuracy of
models trained from scratch or fine-tuned on the underlying data without utilising
the graph connections. As an alternative, we propose Graph-connected Network
(GraNet) layers to better leverage existing unconnected models within a GNN.
Existing language and vision models are thus improved by allowing neighbour-
hood aggregation. This gives a chance for the model to use pre-trained weights, if
possible, and we demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy compared
to traditional GNNs: on Flickr v2, GraNet beats GAT2 and GraphSAGE by 7.7%
and 1.7% respectively.",0
Waveformer: Linear-Time Attention with Forward and Backward Wavelet Transform,"We propose Waveformer that learns attention mechanism in the wavelet coefficient space, requires only linear time complexity, and enjoys universal approximating power. Specifically, we first apply forward wavelet transform to project the input sequences to multi-resolution orthogonal wavelet bases, then conduct nonlinear transformations (in this case, a random feature kernel) in the wavelet coefficient space, and finally reconstruct the representation in input space via backward wavelet transform. We note that other non-linear transformations may be used, hence we name the learning paradigm Wavelet transformatIon for Sequence lEarning (WISE). We emphasize the importance of backward reconstruction in the WISE paradigm — without it, one would be mixing information from both the input space and coefficient space through skip connections, which shall not be considered as mathematically sound. Compared with Fourier transform in recent works, wavelet transform is more efficient in time complexity and better captures local and positional information; we further support this through our ablation studies. Extensive experiments on seven long-range understanding datasets from the Long Range Arena benchmark and code understanding tasks demonstrate that (1) Waveformer achieves competitive and even better accuracy than a number of state-of-the-art Transformer variants and (2) WISE can boost accuracies of various attention approximation methods without increasing the time complexity. These together showcase the superiority of learning attention in a wavelet coefficient space over the input space. ",0
Practical Approaches for Fair Learning with Multitype and Multivariate Sensitive Attributes,"It is important to guarantee that machine learning algorithms deployed in the real world do not result in unfairness or unintended social consequences. Fair ML has largely focused on the protection of single attributes in the simpler setting where both attributes and target outcomes are binary. However, the practical application in many a real-world problem entails the simultaneous protection of multiple sensitive attributes, which are often not simply binary, but continuous or categorical. To address this more challenging task, we introduce FairCOCCO, a fairness measure built on cross-covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert Spaces. This leads to two practical tools: first, the FairCOCCO Score, a normalized metric that can quantify fairness in settings with single or multiple sensitive attributes of arbitrary type; and second, a subsequent regularization term that can be incorporated into arbitrary learning objectives to obtain fair predictors. These contributions address crucial gaps in the algorithmic fairness literature, and we empirically demonstrate consistent improvements against state-of-the-art techniques in balancing predictive power and fairness on real-world datasets.",0
In Search of Smooth Minima for Purifying Backdoor in Deep Neural Networks,"The success of a deep neural network (DNN) heavily relies on the details of the
training scheme; e.g., training data, architectures, hyper-parameters, etc. Recent
backdoor attacks suggest that an adversary can take advantage of such training
details and compromise the integrity of DNN. Our studies show that a backdoor
model is usually optimized to a bad local minima, i.e., sharper minima as compared
to a benign model. Intuitively, backdoor can be purified by re-optimizing the
model to a smoother minima through fine-tuning with a few clean validation data.
However, fine-tuning all DNN parameters often requires huge computational costs as
well as sub-par clean test performance. To address this concern, we propose a novel
backdoor purification technique—N atural G radient Fine-tuning (NGF)—which
focuses on removing backdoor by fine-tuning only one layer. Specifically, NGF
utilizes a loss surface geometry-aware optimizer that can successfully overcome
the challenge of reaching a smooth minima under one-layer optimization scenario.
To enhance the generalization performance of our proposed method, we introduce
a clean data distribution-aware regularizer based on the knowledge of loss surface
curvature matrix, i.e., Fisher Information Matrix. To validate the effectiveness of
our method, we conduct extensive experimentation with four different datasets—
CIFAR10, GTSRB, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet; as well as 11 recent backdoor
attacks, e.g., Blend, Dynamic, Clean Label, etc. NGF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in most of these benchmarks.",0
Evaluating Unsupervised Denoising Requires Unsupervised Metrics,"Unsupervised denoising is a crucial challenge in real-world imaging applications. Unsupervised deep-learning methods have demonstrated impressive performance on benchmarks based on synthetic noise. However, no metrics are available to evaluate these methods in an unsupervised fashion. This is highly problematic for the many practical applications where ground-truth clean images are not available. In this work, we propose two novel metrics: the unsupervised mean squared error (MSE) and the unsupervised peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are computed using only noisy data. We provide a theoretical analysis of these metrics, showing that they are asymptotically consistent estimators of the supervised MSE and PSNR. Controlled numerical experiments with synthetic noise confirm that they provide accurate approximations in practice. We validate our approach on real-world data from two imaging modalities:  videos in raw format and transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metrics enable unsupervised evaluation of denoising methods based exclusively on noisy data.",0
Unmasking the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: What's Encoded in a Winning Ticket's Mask?,"As neural networks get larger and costlier, it is important to find sparse networks that require less compute and memory but can be trained to the same accuracy as the full network (i.e. matching). Iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such highly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP iterates through cycles of training, pruning a fraction of smallest magnitude weights, rewinding unpruned weights back to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the principles underlying when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain elusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the end of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How does SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative pruning needed, i.e. why can't we prune to very high sparsities in one shot? We investigate these questions through the lens of the geometry of the error landscape. First, we find that—at higher sparsities—pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning iterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only if they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training convey to the rewind point the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly connected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this information due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode despite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness of the error landscape at the end of training limits the fraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. This analysis yields a new quantitative link between IMP performance and the Hessian eigenspectrum. Finally, we show that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small weights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the existence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error landscape geometry in the algorithms used to find them.",1
Synergistic Neuromorphic Federated Learning with ANN-SNN Conversion For Privacy Protection,"Federated Learning (FL) has been widely explored for the growing public data privacy issues, where only model parameters are communicated instead of private data. However, recent studies debunk the privacy protection of FL, showing that private data can be leaked from the communicated gradients or parameters updates. In this paper, we propose a framework called Synergistic Neuromorphic Federated Learning (SNFL) that enhances privacy during FL. Before uploading the updates of the client model, SNFL first converts clients' Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) via calibration algorithms. In a way that not only loses almost no accuracy but also encrypts the client model's parameters, SNFL manages to obtain a more performant model with high privacy. After aggregation of various SNNs parameters, server distributes the parameters back to clients to continue training under ANN architecture, providing smooth convergence.  The proposed framework is demonstrated to be private, introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance boosts. Extensive experiments with different kinds of datasets have demonstrated the efficacy and practicability of our method. In most of our experimental IID and not extreme Non-IID scenarios, the SNFL technique has significantly enhanced the model performance.  For instance, SNFL improve the accuracy of FedAvg on Tiny-ImageNet by 13.79%. In the IID situation of tiny-ImageNet, for instance, the SNFL method is 13.79% more accurate than FedAvg.  Also, the original image cannot be reconstructed after 280 iterations of attacks with the SNFL method, whereas it can be reconstructed after just 70 iterations with FedAvg.

Local Coefficient Optimization in Federated Learning,"Federated learning emerges as a promising approach to build a large-scale cooperative learning system among multiple clients without sharing their raw data. However, given a specific global objective, finding the optimal sampling weights for each client remains largely unexplored. This is particularly challenging when clients' data distributions are non-i.i.d. and clients partially participate.

In this paper, we model the above task as a bi-level optimization problem which takes the correlations among different clients into account. We present a double-loop primal-dual-based algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem. We further provide rigorous convergence analysis for our algorithm under mild assumptions. Finally, we perform extensive empirical studies under both toy examples and learning models from real datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",0
Hazard Gradient Penalty for Survival Analysis,"Survival analysis appears in various fields such as medicine, economics, engineering, and business.
Recent studies showed that the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) modeling framework integrates many existing survival models while the framework is flexible and widely applicable.
However, naively applying the ODE framework to survival analysis problems may model fiercely changing density function with respect to covariates which may worsen the model’s performance.
Though we can apply L1 or L2 regularizers to the ODE model, their effect on the ODE modeling framework is barely known.
In this paper, we propose hazard gradient penalty (HGP) to enhance the performance of a survival analysis model.
Our method imposes constraints on local data points by regularizing the gradient of hazard function with respect to the data point.
Our method applies to any survival analysis model including the ODE modeling framework and is easy to implement.
We theoretically show that our method is related to minimizing the KL divergence between the density function at a data point and that of the neighborhood points. 
Experimental results on three public benchmarks show that our approach outperforms other regularization methods. ",0
EUCLID: Towards Efficient Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning with Multi-choice Dynamics Model,"Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) poses a promising paradigm to learn useful behaviors in a task-agnostic environment without the guidance of extrinsic rewards to facilitate the fast adaptation of various downstream tasks. Previous works focused on the pre-training in a model-free manner while lacking the study of transition dynamics modeling that leaves a large space for the improvement of sample efficiency in downstream tasks. To this end, we propose an Efficient Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Framework with Multi-choice Dynamics model (EUCLID), which introduces a novel model-fused paradigm to jointly pre-train the dynamics model and unsupervised exploration policy in the pre-training phase, thus better leveraging the environmental samples and improving the downstream task sampling efficiency. However, constructing a generalizable model which captures the local dynamics under different behaviors remains a challenging problem. We introduce the multi-choice dynamics model that covers different local dynamics under different behaviors concurrently, which uses different heads to learn the state transition under different behaviors during unsupervised pre-training and selects the most appropriate head for prediction in the downstream task. Experimental results in the manipulation and locomotion domains demonstrate that EUCLID achieves state-of-the-art performance with high sample efficiency, basically solving the state-based URLB benchmark and reaching a mean normalized score of 104.0±1.2% in downstream tasks with 100k fine-tuning steps, which is equivalent to DDPG’s performance at 2M interactive steps with 20× more data. More visualization videos are released on our homepage.",1
Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Time Series,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at learning a machine learning model using a labeled source domain that performs well on a similar yet different, unlabeled target domain. UDA is important in many applications such as medicine, where it is used to adapt risk scores across different patient cohorts. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for UDA of time series data, called CLUDA. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning framework to learn contextual representations in multivariate time series, so that these preserve label information for the prediction task. In our framework, we further capture the variation in the contextual representations between source and target domain via a custom nearest-neighbor contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to learn domain-invariant, contextual representation for UDA of time series data. We evaluate our framework using a wide range of time series datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for time series UDA. ",1
Conditional Invariances for Conformer Invariant Protein Representations,"Representation learning for proteins is an emerging area in geometric deep learning. Recent works have factored in both the relational (atomic bonds) and the geometric aspects (atomic positions) of the task, notably bringing together graph neural networks (GNNs) with neural networks for point clouds. The equivariances and invariances to geometric transformations (group actions such as rotations and translations) so far treats large molecules as rigid structures. However, in many important settings, proteins can co-exist as an ensemble of multiple stable conformations. The conformations of a protein, however, cannot be described as input-independent transformations of the protein: Two proteins may require different sets of transformations in order to describe their set of viable conformations. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of conditional transformations (CT). CT can capture protein structure, while respecting the restrictions posed by constraints on dihedral (torsion) angles and steric repulsions between atoms. We then introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to learn representations that are invariant to these conditional transformations. Our results show that endowing existing baseline models with these conditional transformations helps improve their performance without sacrificing computational cost.",0
Relative Positional Encoding Family via Unitary Transformation,"Relative position encoding is widely used in vanilla and linear transformers to represent positional information. However, the existing encoding methods of a vanilla transformer are not always directly applicable to a linear transformer, because the latter requires a decomposition of the query and key representations into separate kernel functions. Nevertheless, principles to design encoding methods suitable for linear transformers remain under-studied. In this work, we put together a variety of existing encoding methods under a canonical form and further propose a family of relative positional encodings via unitary transformation. Our formulation leads to a principled framework that can be used to develop new relative positional encoding methods that preserve linear space-time complexity. Equipping with different parameters, the proposed unitary relative positional encoding family (URPE) derives effective encoding for various applications. Experiments show that compared with existing encoding methods, unitary encoding achieves competitive performance on language modeling and various challenging downstream tasks, such as machine translation and text classification. In the meantime, it highlights a general paradigm to design broadly more relative positional encoding methods, applicable inclusively to linear and vanilla transformers.",0
The Devil is in the Wrongly-classified Samples: Towards Unified Open-set Recognition,"Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to identify test samples whose classes are not seen during the training process. Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition (UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but wrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different training and evaluation settings to shed light on this promising research direction. For this purpose, we first evaluate the UOSR performance of several OSR methods and show a significant finding that the uncertainty distribution of almost all these methods is actually closer to the expectation of UOSR than OSR. We show that the reason lies in the known but wrongly classified samples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown samples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Second, we analyze how the two training settings of OSR (i.e., pre-training and outlier exposure) influence the UOSR. We find although they are both beneficial for distinguishing known and correctly classified samples from unknown samples, pre-training is also helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified samples while outlier exposure is not. In addition to different training settings, we also formulate a new evaluation setting for UOSR which is called few-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available during evaluation to help identify unknown samples. We propose FS-KNNS for the few-shot UOSR to achieve state-of-the-art performance under all settings.",1
Expected Perturbation Scores for Adversarial Detection,"Adversarial detection aims to determine whether a given sample is an adversarial one based on the discrepancy between natural and adversarial distributions. Unfortunately, estimating or comparing two data distributions is extremely difficult, especially in the high-dimension space. Recently, the gradients of log probability density (a.k.a., score) w.r.t. samples is used as an alternative statistic to compute. However, we find that the score is sensitive in identifying adversarial samples due to insufficient information with one sample only. In this paper, we propose a new statistic called expected perturbation score (EPS), which is essentially the expected score of a sample after various perturbations. Specifically, to obtain adequate information regarding one sample, we can perturb it by adding various noises to capture its multi-view observations. We theoretically prove that EPS is a proper statistic to compute the discrepancy between two distributions under mild conditions. In practice, we can use a pre-trained diffusion model to estimate EPS for each sample. Last, we propose an EPS-based adversarial detection (EPS-AD) method, in which we develop EPS-based maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to measure the discrepancy between the test sample and natural samples. To verify the validity of our proposed method, we also prove that the EPS-based MMD between natural and adversarial samples is larger than that among natural samples. Empirical studies on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across different network architectures including ResNet, WideResNet, and ViT show the superior adversarial detection performance of EPS-AD compared to existing methods.",0
MASTER: Multi-task Pre-trained Bottlenecked Masked Autoencoders are Better Dense Retrievers,"Dense retrieval aims to map queries and passages into low-dimensional vector space for efficient similarity measuring, showing promising effectiveness in various large-scale retrieval tasks. Since most existing methods commonly adopt pre-trained Transformers (\eg BERT) for parameter initialization, some work focuses on proposing new pre-training tasks for compressing the useful semantic information from passages into dense vectors, achieving remarkable performances. However, it is still challenging to effectively capture the rich semantic information and relations about passages into the dense vectors via one single particular pre-training task. In this work, we propose a multi-task pre-trained model, MASTER, that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training tasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked autoencoder architecture. Concretely, MASTER utilizes a multi-decoder architecture to integrate three types of pre-training tasks: corrupted passages recovering, related passage recovering and PLMs outputs recovering. By incorporating a shared deep encoder, we construct a representation bottleneck in our architecture, compressing the abundant semantic information across tasks into dense vectors. The first two types of tasks concentrate on the semantic information of passages and capturing relationships among them within the pre-training corpus. The third can capture the knowledge beyond the corpus from external PLMs (\eg GPT-2). Extensive experiments on several large-scale passage retrieval datasets have shown that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.",0
On student-teacher deviations in distillation: does it pay to disobey?,"Knowledge distillation has been widely-used to improve the performance of a ``student'' network by hoping to mimic the soft probabilities of a  ``teacher'' network. Yet, for self-distillation to work, the student {\em must} deviate from the teacher in some manner \citep{stanton21does}. We conduct a variety of experiments across image and language classification datasets to more precisely understand the nature of student-teacher deviations and how they relate to accuracy gains. Our first key empirical observation is that in a majority of our settings, the student underfits points that the teacher finds hard. Next, we find that student-teacher deviations during the \textit{initial} phase training are \textit{not} crucial to get the benefits of distillation --- simply switching to distillation in the middle of training can recover a significant fraction of distillation's accuracy gains.
We then provide two parallel theoretical perspectives of student-teacher deviations, one casting distillation as a regularizer in eigenspace, and another as a denoiser of gradients. In both these views, we argue how our empirically reported student-teacher deviations may emerge, and how they may relate to generalization. Importantly, our analysis bridges key gaps between existing theory and practice by focusing on gradient descent and avoiding label noise assumptions.",0
TextShield: Beyond Successfully Detecting Adversarial Sentences in text classification,"Adversarial attack serves as a major challenge for neural network models in NLP, which precludes the model's deployment in safety-critical applications. A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, {the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms.} To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense. Comprehensive experiments show that (a) TextShield consistently achieves higher or comparable performance than state-of-the-art defense methods across various attacks on different benchmarks. (b) our saliency-based detector outperforms existing detectors for detecting adversarial sentences.",1
Evidential Uncertainty and Diversity Guided Active Learning for Scene Graph Generation,"Scene Graph Generation (SGG) has already shown its great potential in various downstream tasks, but it comes at the price of a prohibitively expensive annotation process. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose using Active Learning (AL) for sampling the most informative data. However, directly porting current AL methods to the SGG task poses the following challenges: 1) unreliable uncertainty estimates, and 2) data bias problems. To deal with these challenges, we propose EDAL (\textbf{E}vidential Uncertainty and \textbf{D}iversity Guided Deep \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning), a novel AL framework tailored for the SGG task. For challenge 1), we start with Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) coupled with a global relationship mining approach to estimate uncertainty, which can effectively overcome the perturbations of open-set relationships and background-relationships to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates. To address challenge 2), we seek the diversity-based method and design the Context Blocking Module (CBM) and Image Blocking Module (IBM) to alleviate context-level bias and image-level bias, respectively. Experiments show that our AL framework can approach the performance of a fully supervised SGG model with only about $10\%$ annotation cost. Furthermore, our ablation studies indicate that introducing AL into the SGG will face many challenges not observed in other vision tasks that are successfully overcome by our new modules. ",1
Trust Your $\nabla$: Gradient-based Intervention Targeting for Causal Discovery,"Inferring causal structure from data is a challenging task of fundamental importance in science. Observational data are often insufficient to identify a system’s causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e., experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel gradient-based intervention targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts' the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to provide signals for intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data regime.",0
Hardware-aware compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing,"Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes.
Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur
significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach
to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more
desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory
for training, quantization can only provide up to $32\times$ compression, HashedNet
is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly,
and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access
Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by clubbing them
through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes
cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access
pattern. ROAST is up to $\sim 25 \times$ faster to train and $\sim 50 \times$ faster to infer than the
popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces
global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local
weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we
can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint
($\sim 10 \times - 100 \times$ lesser) in text and image classification tasks",0
Is Attention All That NeRF Needs?,"We present Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT), a transformer-based architecture that reconstructs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and learns to render novel views on the fly from source views. While prior works on NeRFs optimize a scene representation by inverting a handcrafted rendering equation, GNT achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes using transformers at two stages. (1) The view transformer leverages multi-view geometry as an inductive bias for attention-based scene representation, and predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the sampled points during ray marching. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, GNT can successfully reconstruct NeRF without an explicit rendering formula due to the learned ray renderer. When trained on multiple scenes, GNT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when transferring to unseen scenes and outperform all other methods by ~10% on average. Our analysis of the learned attention maps to infer depth and occlusion indicate that attention enables learning a physically-grounded rendering. Our results show the promise of transformers as a universal modeling tool for graphics. Please refer to our project page for video results: https://vita-group.github.io/GNT/",1
Spotting Expressivity Bottlenecks and Fixing Them Optimally ,"Machine learning tasks are generally formulated as optimization problems, where one searches for an optimal function within a certain functional space. In practice, parameterized functional spaces are considered, in order to be able to perform gradient descent. Typically, a neural network architecture is chosen and fixed, and its parameters (connection weights) are optimized, yielding an architecture-dependent result. This way of proceeding however forces the evolution of the function during training to lie within the realm of what is expressible with the chosen architecture, and prevents any optimization across possible architectures. Costly architectural hyper-parameter optimization is often performed to compensate for this. Instead, we propose to adapt the architecture on the fly during training. We show that the information about desirable architectural changes, due to expressivity bottlenecks when attempting to follow the functional gradient, can be extracted from the back-propagation.  To do this, we propose a new mathematically well-grounded method to detect expressivity bottlenecks on the fly and solve them by adding suitable neurons when and where needed. Thus, while the standard approach requires large networks, in terms of number of neurons per layer, for expressivity and optimization reasons, we are able to start with  very small neural networks and let them grow appropriately.  As a proof of concept, we show convincing results on the MNIST dataset, matching large neural network accuracy, with competitive training time, while removing the need for standard architectural hyper-parameter optimization.

Vera Verto: Multimodal Hijacking Attack,"The increasing cost of training machine learning (ML) models has led to the inclusion of new parties to the training pipeline, such as users who contribute training data and companies that provide computing resources. This involvement of such new parties in the ML training process has introduced new attack surfaces for an adversary to exploit. A recent attack in this domain is the model hijacking attack, whereby an adversary hijacks a victim model to implement their own -- possibly malicious -- hijacking tasks. However, the scope of the model hijacking attack is so far limited to computer vision-related tasks. In this paper, we transform the model hijacking attack into a more general multimodal setting, where the hijacking and original tasks are performed on data of different modalities. Specifically, we focus on the setting where an adversary implements a natural language processing (NLP) hijacking task into an image classification model. To mount the attack, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based framework, namely the Blender, which relies on advanced image and language models. Experimental results show that our modal hijacking attack achieves strong performances in different settings. For instance, our attack achieves 94%, 94%, and 95% attack success rate when using the Sogou news dataset to hijack STL10, CIFAR-10, and MNIST classifiers.",0
Probability flow solution of the Fokker-Planck equation,"The method of choice for integrating the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation in high-dimension is to generate samples from the solution via integration of the associated stochastic differential equation. Here, we introduce an alternative scheme based on integrating an ordinary differential equation that describes the flow of probability. Acting as a transport map, this equation deterministically pushes samples from the initial density onto samples from the solution at any later time. Unlike integration of the stochastic dynamics, the method has the advantage of giving direct access to quantities that are challenging to estimate from trajectories alone, such as the probability current, the density itself, and its entropy. The probability flow equation depends on the gradient of the logarithm of the solution (its ""score""), and so is a-priori unknown. To resolve this dependence, we model the score with a deep neural network that is learned on-the-fly by propagating a set of samples according to the instantaneous probability current. We consider several high-dimensional examples from the physics of interacting particle systems to highlight the efficiency and precision of the approach; we find that the method accurately matches analytical solutions computed by hand and moments computed via Monte-Carlo.",0
FONDUE: an Algorithm to Find the Optimal Dimensionality of the Latent Representations of Variational Autoencoders,"When training a variational autoencoder (VAE) on a given dataset, determining the optimal number of latent variables is mostly done by grid search: a costly process in terms of computational time and carbon footprint.
In this paper, we explore the intrinsic dimension estimation (IDE) of the data and latent representations learned by VAEs.
We show that the discrepancies between the IDE of the mean and sampled representations of a VAE after only a few steps of training reveal the presence of passive variables in the latent space, which, in well-behaved VAEs, indicates a superfluous number of dimensions.
Using this property, we propose FONDUE: an algorithm which quickly finds the number of latent dimensions after which the mean and sampled representations start to diverge (i.e., when passive variables are introduced), providing a principled method for selecting the number of latent dimensions for VAEs and autoencoders.",0
A sampling framework for value-based reinforcement learning,"Value-based algorithms have achieved great successes in solving Reinforcement Learning problems via minimizing the mean squared Bellman error (MSBE). Temporal-difference (TD) algorithms such as Q-learning and SARSA often use stochastic gradient descent based optimization approaches to estimate the value function parameters, but fail to quantify their uncertainties. In our work, under the Kalman filtering paradigm, we establish a novel and scalable sampling framework based on stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, which allows us to efficiently generate samples from the posterior distribution of deep neural network parameters. For TD-learning with both linear and nonlinear function approximation, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary distribution, which allows us to measure uncertainties of the value function and its parameters.",0
kNN-Diffusion: Image Generation via Large-Scale Retrieval,"Recent text-to-image models have achieved impressive results. However, since they require large-scale datasets of text-image pairs, it is impractical to train them on new domains where data is scarce or not labeled.
In this work, we propose using large-scale retrieval methods, in particular, efficient k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN), which offers novel capabilities: (1) training a substantially small and efficient text-to-image diffusion model using only pre-trained multi-modal embeddings, but without an explicit text-image dataset, (2) generating out-of-distribution images by simply swapping the retrieval database at inference time, and (3) performing text-driven local semantic manipulations while preserving object identity. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two state-of-the-art diffusion backbones, and show results on several different datasets. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches that train text-to-image generation models using images-only dataset.",1
Stochastic Bridges as Effective Regularizers for Parameter-Efficient Tuning,"Parameter-efficient tuning methods (PETs) have achieved promising results in tuning large pre-trained language models (PLMs). By formalizing frozen PLMs and additional tunable parameters as systems and controls respectively, PETs can be theoretically grounded to optimal control and further viewed as optimizing terminal cost and running cost in the optimal control literature. Despite the elegance of this theoretical grounding, in practice, existing PETs often ignore the running cost and only optimize the terminal cost, i.e., focus on optimizing the loss function of the output state, regardless of the running cost that depends on the intermediate states. Since it is non-trivial to directly model the intermediate states and design a running cost function, we propose to use latent stochastic bridges to regularize the intermediate states and serve as the running cost of PETs. As the first work to propose regularized PETs that use stochastic bridges as the regularizers (running costs) for intermediate states, we show the effectiveness and generality of this regularization across different tasks, PLMs and PETs. In view of the great potential and capacity, we believe more sophisticated regularizers can be designed for PETs and better performance can be achieved in the future.",0
Contrastive Alignment of Vision to Language Through Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning ,"Contrastive vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) are typically created by updating all the parameters of a vision model and language model through contrastive training. Can such models be created by a small number of parameter updates to an already-trained language model and vision model? The literature describes techniques that can create vision-language models by updating a small number of parameters in a language model, but these require already aligned visual representations and are non-contrastive, hence unusable for latency-sensitive applications such as neural search. We explore the feasibility and benefits of parameter-efficient contrastive vision-language alignment through transfer learning: creating a model such as CLIP by minimally updating an already-trained vision and language model. We find that a minimal set of parameter updates ($<$7\%) can achieve the same performance as full-model training, and updating specific components ($<$1\% of parameters) can match 75\% of full-model training. We describe a series of experiments: we show that existing knowledge is conserved more strongly in parameter-efficient training and that parameter-efficient scaling scales with model and dataset size. Where paired-image text data is scarce but strong multilingual language models exist (e.g. low resource languages), parameter-efficient training is even preferable to full-model training. Given a fixed compute budget, parameter-efficient training allows training larger models on the same hardware, achieving equivalent performance in less time. Parameter-efficient training hence constitutes an energy-efficient and effective training strategy for contrastive vision-language models that may be preferable to the full-model training paradigm for common use cases.

How does Uncertainty-aware Sample-selection Help Decision against Action Noise?,"Learning from imperfect demonstrations has become a vital problem in imitation learning (IL). Since the assumption of the collected demonstrations are optimal cannot always hold in real-world tasks, many previous works considers learning from a mixture of optimal and sub-optimal demonstrations. On the other hand, video records can be hands-down demonstrations in practice. Leveraging such demonstrations requires labors to output action for each frame. However, action noise always occurs when the labors are not domain experts, or meet confusing state frames. Previous IL methods can be vulnerable to such demonstrations with state-dependent action noise. To tackle this problem, we propose a robust learning paradigm called USN, which bridges Uncertainty-aware Sample-selection with Negative learning. First, IL model feeds forward all demonstration data and estimates its predictive uncertainty. Then, we select large-loss samples in the light of the uncertainty measures. Next, we update the model parameters with additional negative learning on the selected samples. Empirical results on Box2D tasks and Atari games demonstrate that USN improves the performance of state-of-the-art IL methods by more than 10% under a large portion of action noise.  ",0
FairGBM: Gradient Boosting with Fairness Constraints,"Tabular data is prevalent in many high-stakes domains, such as financial services or public policy. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are popular in these settings due to their scalability, performance, and low training cost. While fairness in these domains is a foremost concern, existing in-processing Fair ML methods are either incompatible with GBDT, or incur in significant performance losses while taking considerably longer to train. We present FairGBM, a dual ascent learning framework for training GBDT under fairness constraints, with little to no impact on predictive performance when compared to unconstrained GBDT. Since observational fairness metrics are non-differentiable, we propose smooth convex error rate proxies for common fairness criteria, enabling gradient-based optimization using a ``proxy-Lagrangian'' formulation. Our implementation shows an order of magnitude speedup in training time relative to related work, a pivotal aspect to foster the widespread adoption of FairGBM by real-world practitioners.",1
Calibration Matters: Tackling Maximization Bias in Large-scale Advertising Recommendation Systems,"Calibration is defined as the ratio of the average predicted click rate to the true click rate. The optimization of calibration is essential to many online advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the downstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers. Despite its importance, calibration often suffers from a problem called “maximization bias”. Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions are achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the training and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we quantify maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing (VAD) meta-algorithm in this paper. The algorithm is efficient, robust, and practical as it is able to mitigate maximization bias problem under covariate shifts, without incurring additional online serving costs or compromising the ranking performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm  using a state-of-the-art recommendation neural network model on a large-scale real-world dataset.",1
Towards Robust Model Watermark via Reducing Parametric Vulnerability,"Deep neural networks are valuable assets considering their commercial benefits and huge demands for costly annotation and computation resources. To protect the copyright of these deep models, backdoor-based ownership verification becomes popular recently, in which the model owner can watermark the model by embedding a specific behavior before releasing it. The defender (usually the model owner) can identify whether a suspicious third-party model is ``stolen'' from it based on the presence of the behavior. Unfortunately, these watermarks are proven to be vulnerable to removal attacks even like fine-tuning. To further explore this vulnerability, we investigate the parametric space and find there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the watermarked one, which may be easily used by removal attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose a minimax formulation to find these watermark-removed models and recover their watermark behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the robustness of the model watermarking against parametric changes and numerous watermark-removal attacks.",0
Koopman Operator Learning for Accelerating Quantum Optimization and Machine Learning,"Finding efficient optimization methods plays an important role for quantum optimization and quantum machine learning on near-term quantum computers. While backpropagation on classical computers is computationally efficient, obtaining gradients on quantum computers is not, because the computational complexity scales linearly with the number of parameters and measurements. In this paper, we connect Koopman operator theory, which has been successful in predicting nonlinear dynamics, with natural gradient methods in quantum optimization. We propose a data-driven approach using Koopman operator learning to accelerate quantum optimization and quantum machine learning. We develop two new families of methods: the sliding window dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the neural DMD for efficiently updating parameters on quantum computers. We show that our methods can predict gradient dynamics on quantum computers and accelerate the quantum variational eigensolver used in quantum optimization, as well as quantum machine learning. We further implement the learning algorithms on a real quantum computer and demonstrate their practical effectiveness. ",0
Targeted Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning,"Recently, unsupervised adversarial training (AT) has been extensively studied to attain robustness with the models trained upon unlabeled data. To this end, previous studies have applied existing supervised adversarial training techniques to self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks. However, all have resorted to untargeted adversarial learning as obtaining targeted adversarial examples is unclear in the SSL setting lacking of label information. In this paper, we propose a novel targeted adversarial training method for the SSL frameworks. Specifically, we propose a target selection algorithm for the adversarial SSL frameworks; it is designed to select the most confusing sample for each given instance based on similarity and entropy, and perturb the given instance toward the selected target sample. Our method significantly enhances the robustness of an SSL model without requiring large batches of images or additional models, unlike existing works aimed at achieving the same goal. Moreover, our method is readily applicable to general SSL frameworks that only uses positive pairs. We validate our method on benchmark datasets, on which it obtains superior robust accuracies, outperforming existing unsupervised adversarial training methods. ",0
"MobileViTv3: Mobile-Friendly Vision Transformer with Simple and Effective Fusion of Local, Global and Input Features","MobileViT (MobileViTv1) combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) to create light-weight models for mobile vision tasks. Though the main MobileViTv1-block helps to achieve competitive state-of-the-art results, the fusion block inside MobileViTv1-block, creates scaling challenges and has a complex learning task. We propose changes to the fusion block that are simple and effective to create MobileViTv3-block, which addresses the scaling and simplifies the learning task. Our proposed MobileViTv3-block used to create MobileViTv3-XXS, XS and S models outperform MobileViTv1 on ImageNet-1k, ADE20K, COCO and PascalVOC2012 datasets. On ImageNet-1K, MobileViTv3-XXS and MobileViTv3-XS surpasses MobileViTv1-XXS and MobileViTv1-XS by 2% and 1.9% respectively. Recently published MobileViTv2 architecture removes fusion block and uses linear complexity transformers to perform better than MobileViTv1. We add our proposed fusion block to MobileViTv2 to create MobileViTv3-0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 models. MobileViTv3-0.5 and MobileViTv3-0.75 outperforms MobileViTv2-0.5 and MobileViTv2-0.75 by 2.1% and 1.0% respectively on ImageNet-1K dataset.

Learning to Decompose Visual Features with Latent Textual Prompts,"Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models like CLIP have shown great potential in learning transferable visual representations. Nonetheless, for downstream inference, CLIP-like models suffer from either 1) degraded accuracy and robustness in the case of inaccurate text descriptions during retrieval-based inference (the challenge for zero-shot protocol); or 2) breaking the well-established vision-language alignment (the challenge for linear probing). To address them, we propose Decomposed Feature Prompting (DeFo). DeFo leverages a flexible number of learnable embeddings as textual input while maintaining the vision-language dual-model architecture, which enables the model to learn decomposed visual features with the help of feature-level textual prompts. We further use an additional linear layer to perform classification, allowing a scalable size of language inputs. Our empirical study shows DeFo's significance in improving the vision-language models. For example, DeFo obtains 73.2% test accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet-50 backbone without tuning any pretrained weights of both the vision and language encoder, outperforming zero-shot CLIP by a large margin of 15.0%, and outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language prompt tuning method by 7.6%.",1
Comparing Human and Machine Bias in Face Recognition,"Much recent research has uncovered and discussed serious concerns of bias in facial analysis technologies, finding performance disparities between groups of people based on perceived gender, skin type, lighting condition, etc. These audits are immensely important and successful at measuring algorithmic bias but have two major challenges: the audits (1) use facial recognition datasets which lack quality metadata, like LFW and CelebA, and (2) do not compare their observed algorithmic bias to the biases of their human alternatives. In this paper, we release improvements to the LFW and CelebA datasets which will enable future researchers to obtain measurements of algorithmic bias that are not tainted by major flaws in the dataset (e.g. identical images appearing in both the gallery and test set). We also use these new data to develop a series of challenging facial identification and verification questions that we administered to various algorithms and a large, balanced sample of human reviewers. We find that both computer models and human survey participants perform significantly better at the verification task, generally obtain lower accuracy rates on dark-skinned or female subjects for both tasks, and obtain higher accuracy rates when their demographics match that of the question. Academic models exhibit comparable levels of gender bias to humans, but are significantly more biased against darker skin types than humans.",0
3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. We hypothesize that volumetric ConvNets can simulate the large receptive field behavior of these learning approaches with fewer model parameters using depth-wise convolution. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel (LK) size (e.g. starting from $7\times7\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900). The source code with our proposed model are available at https://github.com/MASILab/3DUX-Net.",1
Unbiased Decisions Reduce Regret: Adversarial Optimism for the Bank Loan Problem,"In many real world settings binary classification decisions are made based on limited data in near real-time, e.g. when assessing a loan application. We focus on a class of these problems that share a common feature that the true label is only observed when a data point is assigned a positive label by a learner, e.g. we only learn of an outcome of \emph{accepted} loan applications. In this setting, sometimes referred to as the Bank Loan Problem (BLP) in the literature, the labelled training set suffers from accumulating bias since it is created by learners past decisions. 
Prior work mitigates the consequences of this bias by injecting optimism into the model to allow the learner to correct self-reinforcing false rejections. This reduces long term regret but comes at the cost of a higher false acceptance rate. 
We introduce \emph{adversarial optimism} (AdOpt) to directly address the bias in the training set using \emph{adversarial domain adaptation}. The goal of AdOpt is to learn an unbiased but informative representation of past data, by reducing the distributional shift between the set of \textit{accepted} data points and all data points seen thus far.  AdOpt integrates classification made using this debiased representation of the data with the recently proposed \emph{pseudo-label optimism}(PLOT) method to increase the rate of correct decisions at every timestep.
AdOpt significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance on a set of challenging BLP benchmark problems.",0
Hard-Meta-Dataset++: Towards Understanding Few-Shot Performance on Difficult Tasks,"Few-shot classification is the ability to adapt to any new classification task from only a few training examples. The performance of current top-performing few-shot classifiers varies widely across different tasks where they often fail on a subset of `difficult' tasks.
This phenomenon has real-world consequences for deployed few-shot systems where safety and reliability are paramount, yet little has been done to understand these failure cases. In this paper, we study these difficult tasks to gain a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of current methods. To this end, we develop a general and computationally efficient algorithm called FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from any large-scale vision dataset. Notably, our algorithm can extract tasks at least 20x faster than existing methods enabling its use on large-scale datasets. We use FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from Meta-Datasset, a widely-used few-shot classification benchmark, and other challenging large-scale vision datasets including ORBIT, CURE-OR and ObjectNet. These tasks are curated into Hard-MD++, a new few-shot testing benchmark to promote the development of methods that are robust to even the most difficult tasks. We use Hard-MD++ to stress-test an extensive suite of few-shot classification methods and show that state-of-the-art approaches fail catastrophically on difficult tasks. We believe that our extraction algorithm FastDiffSel and Hard-MD++ will aid researchers in further understanding failure modes of few-shot classification models.",1
Fairness-aware Contrastive Learning with Partially Annotated Sensitive Attributes,"Learning high-quality representation is important and essential for visual recognition. Unfortunately, traditional representation learning suffers from fairness issues since the model may learn information of sensitive attributes. Recently, a series of studies have been proposed to improve fairness by explicitly decorrelating target labels and sensitive attributes. Most of these methods, however, rely on the assumption that fully annotated labels on target variable and sensitive attributes are available, which is unrealistic due to the expensive annotation cost. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical problem of Fair Unsupervised Representation Learning with Partially annotated Sensitive labels (FURL-PS). FURL-PS has two key challenges: 1) how to make full use of the samples that are not annotated with sensitive attributes; 2) how to eliminate bias in the dataset without target labels. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fairness-aware Contrastive Learning (FairCL) framework consisting of two stages. Firstly, we generate contrastive sample pairs, which share the same visual information apart from sensitive attributes, for each instance in the original dataset. In this way, we construct a balanced and unbiased dataset. Then, we execute fair contrastive learning by closing the distance between representations of contrastive sample pairs. Besides, we also propose an unsupervised way to balance the utility and fairness of learned representations by feature reweighting. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of fairness and utility, even with very limited sensitive attributes and serious data bias.",1
Brain Signal Generation and Data Augmentation with a Single-Step Diffusion Probabilistic Model,"Brain-computer interfaces based on deep learning rely on large amounts of high-quality data. Finding publicly available brain signal datasets that meet all requirements is a challenge. However, brain signals synthesized with generative models may provide a solution to this problem. Our work builds on diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) and aims to generate brain signals that have the properties needed to develop further classification models based on deep learning. We show that our DPM can generate high-quality event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) signals. Furthermore, with the progressive distillation of the model, subject-specific data can be produced in a one-step reverse process. We augment publicly available datasets and demonstrate the impact of the generated signals on a deep learning classification model. DPMs are versatile models, and this work shows that brain signal processing is one of many other tasks in which these models can be useful.",0
Double dynamic sparse training for GANs,"The past decade has witnessed a drastic increase in modern deep neural networks (DNNs) size, especially for generative adversarial networks (GANs). Since GANs usually suffer from high computational complexity, researchers have shown an increased interest in applying pruning methods to reduce the training and inference costs of GANs. Among different pruning methods invented for supervised learning, dynamic sparse training (DST) has gained increasing attention recently as it enjoys excellent training efficiency with comparable performance to post-hoc pruning. Hence, applying DST on GANs, where we train a sparse GAN with a fixed parameter count throughout training, seems to be a good candidate for reducing GAN training costs. However, a few challenges, including the degrading training instability, emerge due to the adversarial nature of GANs. Hence, we introduce a quantity called balance ratio (BR) to quantify the balance of the generator and the discriminator. We conduct a series of experiments to show the importance of BR in understanding sparse GAN training. Building upon single dynamic sparse training (SDST), where only the generator is adjusted during training, we propose double dynamic sparse training (DDST) to control the BR during GAN training. Empirically, DDST automatically determines the density of the discriminator and greatly boosts the performance of sparse GANs on multiple datasets.",0
Which Layer is Learning Faster? A Systematic Exploration of Layer-wise Convergence Rate for Deep Neural Networks,"The deeply hierarchical structures enable deep neural networks (DNNs) to fit extremely complex target functions. However, the complex interaction between layers also makes the learning process of a particular layer poorly understood. This work demonstrates that the shallower layers of DNNs tend to converge faster than the deeper layers. We call this phenomenon Layer Convergence Bias. We also uncover the fundamental reason behind this phenomenon: Flatter local minima of shallower layers make their gradients more stable and predictive, allowing for faster training. Another surprising result is that the shallower layers tend to learn the low-frequency components of the target function, while the deeper layers usually learn the high-frequency components. It is consistent with the recent discovery that DNNs learn lower frequency objects faster.",1
A Closer Look at Model Adaptation using Feature Distortion and Simplicity Bias,"Advances in the expressivity of pretrained models have increased interest in the design of adaptation protocols which enable safe and effective transfer learning. Going beyond conventional linear probing (LP) and fine tuning (FT) strategies, protocols that can effectively control feature distortion, i.e., the failure to update features orthogonal to the in-distribution, have been found to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization (OOD). In order to limit this distortion, the LP+FT protocol, which first learns a linear probe and then uses this initialization for subsequent FT, was proposed. However, in this paper, we find when adaptation protocols (LP, FT, LP+FT) are also evaluated on a variety of safety objectives (e.g., calibration, robustness, etc.), a complementary perspective to feature distortion is helpful to explain protocol behavior. To this end, we study the susceptibility of protocols to simplicity bias (SB), i.e. the well-known propensity of deep neural networks to rely upon simple features, as SB has recently been shown to underlie several problems in robust generalization. Using a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the susceptibility of existing protocols to SB. Given the strong effectiveness of LP+FT, we then propose modified linear probes that help mitigate SB, and lead to better initializations for subsequent FT. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed LP+FT variants for decreasing SB in a controlled setting, and their ability to improve OOD generalization and safety on three adaptation datasets.",1
Cross-Window Self-Training via Context Variations from Sparsely-Labeled Time Series,"A real-world time series is often sparsely labeled due to the expensive annotation cost. Recently, self-training methods have been applied to a dataset with few labels to infer the labels of unlabeled augmented instances. Accelerating this trend for time-series data, fully taking advantage of its sequential nature, we propose a novel data augmentation approach called context-additive augmentation, which allows a target instance to be augmented easily by adding preceding and succeeding instances to form an augmented instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques which may alter the target instance by directly perturbing its features, it preserves a target instance as is but still gives various augmented instances with varying contexts. Additionally, we propose a cross-window self-training framework based on the context-additive augmentation. The framework first augments target instances by applying context-varying windows over a given time series. Then, the framework derives reliability-based cross-window labels and uses them to maintain consistency among augmented instances across the windows. Extensive experiments using real datasets show that the framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art self-training methods.",0
On the Importance of Contrastive Loss in Multimodal Learning,"Recently, contrastive learning approaches (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)) have received huge success in multimodal learning, where the model tries to minimize the distance between the representations of diﬀerent views (e.g., image and its caption) of the same data point, while keep the representations of diﬀerent data points away from each other. However, from a theoretical perspective, it is unclear how contrastive learning can learn to align the representations from diﬀerent views eﬃciently, especially in cases where the data is not isotropic. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of a simple multimodal contrastive learning model, and show that contrastive pairs are important for the model to eﬃciently balance the learned representations. In particular, we reveal a stage-wise behavior of the learning process: In the ﬁrst stage, the model aligns the feature representations using positive pairs and the condition number grows in this stage. Then, in the second stage, the model reduces the condition number of the learned representations using negative pairs.",0
Robust and Controllable Object-Centric Learning through Energy-based Models,"Humans are remarkably good at understanding and reasoning about complex visual scenes. The capability of decomposing low-level observations into discrete objects allows us to build a grounded abstract representation and identify the compositional structure of the world. Thus it is a crucial step for machine learning models to be capable of inferring objects and their properties from visual scene without explicit supervision. However, existing works on object-centric representation learning are either relying on tailor-made neural network modules or assuming sophisticated models of underlying generative and inference processes. In this work, we present EGO, a conceptually simple and general approach to learning object-centric representation through energy-based model. By forming a permutation-invariant energy function using vanilla attention blocks that are readily available in Transformers, we can infer object-centric latent variables via gradient-based MCMC methods where permutation equivariance is automatically guaranteed. We show that EGO can be easily integrated into existing architectures, and can effectively extract high-quality object-centric representations, leading to better segmentation accuracy and competitive downstream task performance. We empirically evaluate the robustness of the learned representation from EGO against distribution shift. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EGO in systematic compositional generalization, by recomposing learned energy functions for novel scene generation and manipulation.",1
Task Regularized Hybrid Knowledge Distillation For Continual Object Detection,"Knowledge distillation has been used to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Continual Object Detection(COD) task. Previous works mainly focus on combining different distillation methods, including feature, classification, location and relation, into a mixed scheme to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a task regularized hybrid knowledge distillation method for COD task. First, we propose an image-level hybrid knowledge representation by combining instance-level hard and soft knowledge to use teacher knowledge critically. Second, we propose a task-based regularization distillation loss by taking account of loss and category differences to make continual learning more balance between old and new tasks. We find that, under appropriate knowledge selection and transfer strategies, using only classification distillation can also relieve knowledge forgetting effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO2017 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results under various scenarios. We get an absolute improvement of 27.98 at $RelGap$ under the most difficult five-task scenario. Code is in attachment and will be available on github.",0
Contrastive Learning of Molecular Representation with Fragmented Views,"Molecular representation learning is a fundamental task for AI-based drug design and discovery. Contrastive learning is an attractive framework for this task, as also evidenced in various domains of representation learning, e.g., image, language, and speech. However, molecule-specific ways of constructing good positive or negative views in contrastive training under consideration of their chemical semantics have been relatively under-explored. In this paper, we consider a molecule as a bag of meaningful fragments, e.g., functional groups, by disconnecting a non-ring single bond as the semantic-preserving transformation. Then, we suggest to construct a complete (or incomplete) bag of fragments as the positive (or negative) views of a molecule: each fragment loses chemical substructures from the original molecule, while the union of the fragments does not. Namely, this provides easy positive and hard negative views simultaneously for contrastive representation learning so that it can selectively learn useful features and ignore nuisance features. Furthermore, we additionally suggest to optimize the torsional angle reconstruction loss around the fragmented bond to incorporate with 3D geometric structure in the pre-training dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms prior state-of-the-art molecular representation learning methods across various downstream molecule property prediction tasks.",0
Neural Field Discovery Disentangles Equivariance in Interacting Dynamical Systems,"Systems of interacting objects often evolve under the influence of underlying field effects that govern their dynamics, \emph{e.g.} electromagnetic fields in physics, or map topologies and traffic rules in traffic scenes. While the interactions between objects depend on local information, the underlying fields depend on global states. Pedestrians and vehicles in traffic scenes, for example, follow different traffic rules and social norms depending on their absolute geolocation. The entanglement of global and local effects makes recently popularized equivariant networks inapplicable, since they fail to capture global information. To address this, in this work, we propose to \emph{disentangle} local object interactions --which are equivariant to global roto-translations and depend on relative positions and orientations-- from external global field effects --which depend on absolute positions and orientations. We theorize the presence of latent fields, which we aim to discover \emph{without} directly observing them, but infer them instead from the dynamics alone. We propose neural fields to learn the latent fields, and model the interactions with equivariant graph networks operating in local coordinate frames. We combine the two components in a graph network that transforms field effects in local frames and operates solely there. Our experiments show that we can accurately discover the underlying fields in charged particles settings, traffic scenes, and gravitational n-body problems, and effectively use them to learn the system and forecast future trajectories.",0
That Label's got Style: Handling Label Style Bias for Uncertain Image Segmentation,"Segmentation uncertainty models predict a distribution over plausible segmentations for a given input, which they learn from the annotator variation in the training set. However, in practice these annotations can differ systematically in the way they are generated, for example through the use of different labeling tools. This results in datasets that contain both data variability and differing label styles. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art segmentation uncertainty models on such datasets can lead to model bias caused by the different label styles. We present an updated modelling objective conditioning on labeling style for aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and modify two state-of-the-art-architectures for segmentation uncertainty accordingly. We show with extensive experiments that this method reduces label style bias, while improving segmentation performance, increasing the applicability of segmentation uncertainty models in the wild. We curate two datasets, with annotations in different label styles, which we will make publicly available along with our code upon publication.",1
HyperQuery: A Framework for Higher Order Link Prediction,"Groups with complex set intersection relations are a natural way to model a wide array of data, from the formation of social groups to the complex protein interactions which form the basis of biological life.  While graphs are a natural way to represent complex networks and are well studied, typical approaches to modeling group membership using graphs are lossy.  Hypergraphs are a more natural way to represent such ``higher order'' relationships, but efforts to apply machine learning techniques to hypergraph structured datasets have been limited thus far.  In this paper, we address the problem of link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs as well as regular hypergraphs and develop a novel, simple, and effective optimization architecture to solve this task. Additionally, we study how integrating data from node-level labels can improve the results of our system. Our self-supervised approach achieves significant improvement over state of the art results on several hyperedge prediction and knowledge hypergraph completeion benchmarks. ",0
Is margin all you need? An extensive empirical study of active learning on tabular data,"Given a labeled training set and a collection of unlabeled data, the goal of active learning (AL) is to identify the best unlabeled points to label. In this comprehensive study, we analyze the performance of a variety of AL algorithms on deep neural networks trained on 69 real-world tabular classification datasets from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark. We consider different data regimes and the effect of self-supervised model pre-training. Surprisingly, we find that the classical margin sampling technique matches or outperforms all others, including current state-of-art, in a wide range of experimental settings. To researchers, we hope to encourage rigorous benchmarking against margin, and to practitioners facing tabular data labeling constraints that hyper-parameter-free margin may often be all they need.",0
Speed Up Iterative Non-Autoregressive Transformers by Distilling Multiple Steps,"The computational benefits of iterative non-autoregressive transformers decrease as the number of decoding steps increases. As a remedy, we introduce Distill Multiple Steps (DiMS), a simple yet effective distillation technique to decrease the number of required steps to reach a certain translation quality. The distilled model enjoys the computational benefits of early iterations while preserving the enhancements from several iterative steps. DiMS relies on two models namely student and teacher. The student is optimized to predict the output of the teacher after multiple decoding steps while the teacher follows the student via a slow-moving average. The moving average keeps the teacher's knowledge updated and enhances the quality of the labels provided by the teacher. During inference, the student is used for translation and no additional computation is added. We verify the effectiveness of DiMS on various models obtaining 7 and 12.9 BLEU points improvements on distilled and raw versions of WMT'14 De-En, respectively.",0
Hierarchies of Reward Machines,"Reward machines (RMs) are a recent formalism for representing the reward function of a reinforcement learning task through a finite-state machine whose edges encode landmarks of the task using high-level events. The structure of RMs enables the decomposition of a task into simpler and independently solvable subtasks that help tackle long-horizon and/or sparse reward tasks. We propose a formalism for further abstracting the subtask structure by endowing an RM with the ability to call other RMs, thus composing a hierarchy of RMs (HRM). We exploit HRMs by treating each call to an RM as an independently solvable subtask using the options framework, and describe a curriculum-based method to learn HRMs from traces observed by the agent. Our experiments reveal that exploiting a handcrafted HRM leads to faster convergence than with a flat HRM, and that learning an HRM remains feasible in cases where its equivalent flat representation is not.",0
GraphCG: Unsupervised Discovery of Steerable Factors in Graphs,"Deep generative models have been widely developed for graph data such as molecular graphs and point clouds. Yet, much less investigation has been carried out on understanding the learned latent space of deep graph generative models. Such understandings can open up a unified perspective and provide guidelines for essential tasks like controllable generation. To this end, this work develops a method called GraphCG for unsupervised discovery of steerable factors in latent space of deep graph generative models. We first examine the representation space of the recent deep generative models trained for graph data, and observe that the learned representation space is not perfectly disentangled. Thus, our method is designed for discovering steerable factors of graph data in a model-agnostic and task-agnostic manner. Specifically, GraphCG learns the semantic-rich directions via maximizing the corresponding mutual information, where the edited graph along the same direction will possess certain steerable factors. We conduct experiments on two types of graph data, molecular graphs and point clouds. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of GraphCG for discovering steerable factors.",0
DeepGRAND: Deep Graph Neural Diffusion,"We propose the Deep Graph Neural Diffusion (DeepGRAND), a class of continuous-depth graph neural networks based on the diffusion process on graphs. DeepGRAND leverages a data-dependent scaling term and a perturbation to the graph diffusivity to make the real part of all eigenvalues of the diffusivity matrix become negative, which ensures two favorable theoretical properties: (i) the node representation does not exponentially converge to a constant vector as the model depth increases, thus alleviating the over-smoothing issue; (ii) the stability of the model is guaranteed by controlling the norm of the node representation. Compared to the baseline GRAND, DeepGRAND mitigates the accuracy drop-off with increasing depth and improves the overall accuracy of the model. We empirically corroborate the advantage of DeepGRAND over many existing graph neural networks on various graph deep learning benchmark tasks.",0
Hyper-parameter Tuning for Fair Classification without Sensitive Attribute Access,"Fair machine learning methods seek to train models that balance model performance across demographic subgroups defined over sensitive attributes like race and gender. Although sensitive attributes are typically assumed to be known during training, they may not be available in practice due to privacy and other logistical concerns. Recent work has sought to train fair models without sensitive attributes on training data. However, these methods need extensive hyper-parameter tuning to achieve good results, and hence assume that sensitive attributes are known on validation data. However, this assumption too might not be practical. Here, we propose a framework to train fair classifiers without access to sensitive attributes on either training or validation data. Instead, we generate pseudo sensitive attributes on the validation data by training a biased classifier and using the classifier’s incorrectly (correctly) labeled examples as proxies for minority (majority) groups. Since fairness metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity and subgroup accuracy can be estimated to within a proportionality constant even with noisy sensitive attribute information, we show theoretically and empirically that these proxy labels can be used to maximize fairness under average accuracy constraints. Key to our results is a principled approach to select the hyper-parameters of the biased classifier in a completely unsupervised fashion (meaning without access to ground truth sensitive attributes) that minimizes the gap between fairness estimated using noisy versus ground-truth sensitive labels.",0
ASGNN: Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Structure,"The graph neural network (GNN) has presented impressive achievements in numerous machine learning tasks. However, many existing GNN models are shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which makes it essential to build robust GNN architectures. In this work, we propose a novel interpretable message passing scheme with adaptive structure (ASMP) to defend against adversarial attacks on graph structure. Layers in ASMP are derived based on optimization steps that minimize an objective function that simultaneously learns the node feature and the graph structure. ASMP is adaptive in the sense that the message passing process in different layers is able to be carried out over different graphs. Such a property allows more fine-grained handling of the noisy graph structure and hence improves the robustness. Integrating ASMP with neural networks can lead to a new family of GNNs with adaptive structure (ASGNN). Extensive experiments on semi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed ASGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN architectures with respect to classification performance under various graph adversarial attacks.",0
Near Optimal Private and Robust Linear Regression,"We study the canonical statistical estimation problem of linear regression from $n$ i.i.d. examples under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy when a fraction of response variables are adversarially corrupted.   We propose a variant of the popular differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm with two innovations: a full-batch gradient descent to improve sample complexity and a novel adaptive clipping to guarantee robustness. When there is no adversarial corruption, this algorithm improves upon the existing state-of-the-art approach and achieves near optimal sample complexity. Under label-corruption, this is the first efficient linear regression algorithm to provably guarantee both $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and robustness. Synthetic experiments confirm the superiority of our approach. ",0
A Cognitive-inspired Multi-Module Architecture for Continual Learning,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit a narrow scope of expertise on stationary independent data. However, data in the real world is continuous and dynamic, and ANNs must adapt to novel scenarios while also retaining the learned knowledge to become lifelong learners. The ability of humans to excel at these tasks can be attributed to multiple factors ranging from cognitive computational structures, cognitive biases, and the multi-memory systems in the brain. We incorporate key concepts from each of these to design a cognitive-inspired continual learning method. Cognitive Continual Learner (CCL) includes multiple modules, implicit and explicit knowledge representation dichotomy, inductive bias, and a multi-memory system. CCL shows improvement across all continual learning settings and also exhibits reduced task recency bias. To test versatility of continual learning methods on a challenging distribution shift, we introduce a novel domain-incremental dataset Domain${^2}$IL. In addition to improved performance on existing benchmarks, CCL also demonstrates superior performance on this dataset.",0
Dynamic Embeddings of Temporal High-Order Interactions via Neural Diffusion-Reaction Processes,"High-order interactions of multiple entities are ubiquitous in practical applications. The associated data often includes the participants, interaction results, and the timestamps when each interaction occurred. While tensor factorization is a popular tool to analyze such data, it often ignores or underuses valuable timestamp information. More important, standard tensor factorization only estimates a static representation for each entity and ignores the temporal variation of the representations. However, such variations might reflect important evolution patterns of the underlying properties of the entities. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamical eMbedIngs of TempoRal hIgh-order interactions (DMITRI). We develop a neural diffusion-reaction process model to estimate the dynamic embeddings for the participant entities. Specifically, based on the observed interactions, we build a multi-partite graph to encode the correlation between the entities. We construct a graph diffusion process to co-evolve the embedding trajectories of the correlated entities and use a neural network to construct a reaction process for each individual entity. In this way, our model is able to capture both the commonalities and personalities during the evolution of the embeddings for different entities. We then use a neural network to model the interaction result as a nonlinear function of the embedding trajectories. For model estimation, we combine ODE solvers to develop a stochastic mini-batch learning algorithm. We propose a simple stratified sampling method to balance the cost of processing each mini-batch so as to improve the overall efficiency. We show the advantage of our approach in both the ablation study and real-world applications. ",0
Modeling the Uncertainty with Maximum Discrepant Students for Semi-supervised 2D Pose Estimation,"Semi-supervised pose estimation is a practically challenging task for computer vision. Although numerous excellent semi-supervised classification methods have emerged, these methods typically use confidence to evaluate the quality of pseudo-labels, which is difficult to achieve in pose estimation tasks. For example, in pose estimation, confidence represents only the possibility that a position of the heatmap is a keypoint, not the quality of that prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient framework to estimate the quality of pseudo-labels in semi-supervised pose estimation tasks from the perspective of modeling the uncertainty of the pseudo-labels. Concretely, under the dual mean-teacher framework, we construct the two maximum discrepant students (MDSs) to effectively push two teachers to generate different decision boundaries for the same sample. Moreover, we create multiple uncertainties to assess the quality of the pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performance of semi-supervised pose estimation on three datasets.",0
Safe Exploration Incurs Nearly No Additional Sample Complexity for Reward-Free RL,"Reward-free reinforcement learning (RF-RL), a recently introduced RL paradigm, relies on random action-taking to explore the unknown environment without any reward feedback information. While the primary goal of the exploration phase in RF-RL is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated model with minimum number of trajectories, in practice, the agent often needs to abide by certain safety constraint at the same time. It remains unclear how such safe exploration requirement would affect the corresponding sample complexity in order to achieve the desired optimality of the obtained policy in planning. In this work, we make a first attempt to answer this question. In particular, we consider the scenario where a safe baseline policy is known beforehand, and propose a unified Safe reWard-frEe ExploraTion (SWEET) framework. We then particularize the SWEET framework to the tabular and the low-rank MDP settings, and develop algorithms coined Tabular-SWEET and Low-rank-SWEET, respectively. Both algorithms leverage the concavity and continuity of the newly introduced truncated value functions, and are guaranteed to achieve zero constraint violation during exploration with high probability. Furthermore, both algorithms can provably find a near-optimal policy subject to any constraint in the planning phase. Remarkably, the sample complexities under both algorithms match or even outperform the state of the art in their constraint-free counterparts up to some constant factors, proving that safety constraint hardly increases the sample complexity for RF-RL.",1
Efficient and Stealthy Backdoor Attack Triggers are Close at Hand,"A backdoor attack aims to inject a backdoor into a deep model so that the model performs normally on benign samples while maliciously predicting the input as the attacker-defined target class when the backdoor is activated by a predefined trigger pattern. Most existing backdoor attacks use a pattern that rarely occurs in benign data as the trigger pattern. In this way, the impact of the attack on the label prediction of benign data can be mitigated. However, this practice also results in the attack being defended against with little performance degradation on benign data by preventing the trigger pattern from being activated. In this work, we present a new attack strategy to solve this dilemma. Unlike the conventional strategy, our strategy extracts the trigger pattern from benign training data, which frequently occurs in samples of the target class but rarely occurs in samples of the other classes. Compared with the prevailing strategy, our proposed strategy has two advantages. First, it can improve the efficiency of the attack because learning on benign samples of the target class can facilitate the fitting of the trigger pattern. Second, it increases the difficulty or cost of identifying the trigger pattern and preventing its activation, since many benign samples of the target class contain the trigger pattern. We empirically evaluate our strategy on four benchmark datasets. The experimental studies show that attacks performed with our strategy can achieve much better performance when poisoning only 0.1\% or more of the training data, and can achieve better performance against several benchmark defense algorithms.",0
Ordered GNN: Ordering Message Passing to Deal with Heterophily and Over-smoothing,"Most graph neural networks follow the message passing mechanism. However, it faces the over-smoothing problem when multiple times of message passing is applied to a graph, causing indistinguishable node representations and prevents the model to effectively learn dependencies between farther-away nodes. On the other hand, features of neighboring nodes with different labels are likely to be falsely mixed, resulting in the heterophily problem. In this work, we propose to order the messages passing into the node representation, with specific blocks of neurons targeted for message passing within specific hops. This is achieved by aligning the hierarchy of the rooted-tree of a central node with the ordered neurons in its node representation. Experimental results on an extensive set of datasets show that our model can simultaneously achieve the state-of-the-art in both homophily and heterophily settings, without any targeted design. Moreover, its performance maintains pretty well while the model becomes really deep, effectively preventing the over-smoothing problem. Finally, visualizing the gating vectors shows that our model learns to behave differently between homophily and heterophily settings, providing an explainable graph neural model.",1
Value-Based Membership Inference Attack on Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning,"In actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL), the so-called actor and critic, respectively, compute candidate policies and a value function that evaluates the candidate policies. Such RL algorithms may be vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), a privacy attack that infers the data membership, i.e., whether a specific data record belongs to the training dataset. We investigate the vulnerability of value function in actor-critic to MIAs. We develop \textit{CriticAttack}, a new MIA that targets black-box RL agents by examining the correlation between the expected reward and the value function. We empirically show that \textit{CriticAttack} can correctly infer approximately 90\% of the training data membership, i.e., it achieves 90\% attack accuracy. Such accuracy is far beyond the 50\% random guessing accuracy, indicating a severe privacy vulnerability of the value function. To defend against \textit{CriticAttack}, we design a method called \textit{CriticDefense} that inserts uniform noise to the value function. \textit{CriticDefense} can reduce the attack accuracy to 60\% without significantly affecting the agent’s performance.",0
$\epsilon$-Invariant Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Building Generalizable Policy,"Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has shown remarkable potential for solving complex control tasks. However, existing methods struggle in tasks that require generalization since the learned subgoals are highly task-specific and therefore hardly reusable. In this paper, we propose a novel HRL framework called \textit{$\epsilon$-Invariant HRL} that uses abstract, task-agnostic subgoals reusable across tasks, resulting in a more generalizable policy. Although such subgoals are reusable, a transition mismatch problem caused by the inevitable incorrect value evaluation of subgoals can lead to non-stationary learning and even collapse. We mitigate this mismatch problem by training the high-level policy to be adaptable to the stochasticity manually injected into the low-level policy. As a result, our framework can leverage reusable subgoals to constitute a hierarchical policy that can effectively generalize to unseen new tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results in continuous control navigation tasks and challenging zero-shot generalization tasks show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",0
VER: Learning Natural Language Representations for Verbalizing Entities and Relations,"Entities and relationships between entities are vital in the real world. Essentially, we understand the world by understanding entities and relations. For instance, to understand a field, e.g., computer science, we need to understand the relevant concepts, e.g., machine learning, and the relationships between concepts, e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence. To understand a person, we should first know who he/she is and how he/she is related to others. To understand entities and relations, humans may refer to natural language descriptions. For instance, when learning a new scientific term, people usually start by reading its definition in dictionaries or encyclopedias. To know the relationship between two entities, humans tend to create a sentence to connect them. In this paper, we propose VER: A Unified Model for Verbalizing Entities and Relations. Specifically, we attempt to build a system that takes any entity or entity set as input and generates a sentence to represent entities and relations, named ``natural language representation''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can generate high-quality sentences describing entities and entity relationships and facilitate various tasks on entities and relations, including definition modeling, relation modeling, and generative commonsense reasoning.",0
Personalized Reward Learning with Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL),"In an era of countless content offerings, recommender systems alleviate information overload by providing users with personalized content suggestions. Due to the scarcity of explicit user feedback, modern recommender systems typically optimize for the same fixed combination of implicit feedback signals across all users. However, this approach disregards a growing body of work highlighting that (i) implicit signals can be used by users in diverse ways, signaling anything from satisfaction to active dislike, and (ii) different users communicate preferences in different ways. We propose applying the recent Interaction Grounded Learning (IGL) paradigm to address the challenge of learning representations of diverse user communication modalities. Rather than requiring a fixed, human-designed reward function, IGL is able to learn personalized reward functions for different users and then optimize directly for the latent user satisfaction. We demonstrate the success of IGL with experiments using simulations as well as with real-world production traces.

HYPERPRUNING: EFFICIENT PRUNING THROUGH LYAPUNOV METRIC HYPERSEARCH,"A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized recurrent neural networks to improve efficiency in terms of power and storage. With the advance in pruning methods and their variety, a new problem of ‘hyperpruning’ is becoming apparent: finding a suitable pruning method with optimal hyperparameter configuration for a particular task and network. Such search is different from the standard hyperparameter search, where the accuracy of the optimal configuration is unknown. In the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the non-pruned (dense) model sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned model. Thereby, the goal of hyperpruning is to reach or even surpass this target. It is critical to develop efficient strategies for hyperpruning since direct search through pruned variants would require time-consuming training without guarantees for improved performance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel distance based on Lyapunov Spectrum (LS) which provides means to compare pruned variants with the dense model and early in training to estimate the accuracy that pruned variants will achieve after extensive training. The ability to predict performance allows us to incorporate the LS-based distance with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization methods and to propose an efficient and first-of-its-kind hyperpruning approach called LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH) which can optimize the search time by an order of magnitude compared to standard full training search with the loss (or perplexity) being the accuracy metric. Our experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN language models trained with the Penn Treebank dataset show that with a given budget of training epochs and desired pruning ratio, LSH obtains more optimal variants than standard loss-based hyperparameter optimization methods. Furthermore, as a result of the search, LSH identifies pruned variants that outperform state-of-the-art pruning methods and surpass the accuracy of the dense model.",0
Pushing the limits of self-supervised learning: Can we outperform supervised learning without labels?,"Despite recent progress made by self-supervised methods in representation learning with residual networks, they still underperform supervised learning on the ImageNet classification benchmark, limiting their applicability in performance critical settings. Building  on  prior  theoretical  insights  from  RELIC  [Mitrovic et  al.,  2021],  we  include  additional  inductive  biases  into  self-supervised  learning. We propose a new self-supervised representation learning method, RELICv2,which  combines  an  explicit  invariance  loss  with  a  contrastive  objective  over  avaried set of appropriately constructed data views to avoid learning spurious cor-relations and obtain more informative representations. RELICv2 achieves 77.1% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using linear evaluation with a ResNet50 architecture and 80.6% with larger ResNet models, outperforming previous state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches by a wide margin. Most notably, RELICv2 is the first unsupervised representation learning method to consistently outperform the supervised baseline in a like-for-like comparison over a range of ResNet architectures. Finally, we show that despite using ResNet encoders, RELICv2 is comparable to state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformers.",0
Bidirectional Language Models Are Also Few-shot Learners,"Large language models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) can perform arbitrary tasks without undergoing fine-tuning after being prompted with only a few labeled examples. An arbitrary task can be reformulated as a natural language prompt, and a language model can be asked to generate the completion, indirectly performing the task in a paradigm known as prompt-based learning. To date, emergent prompt-based learning capabilities have mainly been demonstrated for unidirectional language models. However, bidirectional language models pre-trained on denoising objectives such as masked language modeling produce stronger learned representations for transfer learning. This motivates the possibility of prompting bidirectional models, but their pre-training objectives have made them largely incompatible with the existing prompting paradigm. We present SAP (Sequential Autoregressive Prompting), a technique that enables the prompting of bidirectional models. Utilizing the machine translation task as a case study, we prompt the bidirectional mT5 model (Xue et al., 2021) with SAP and demonstrate its few-shot and zero-shot translations outperform the few-shot translations of unidirectional models like GPT-3 and XGLM (Lin et al., 2021), despite mT5's approximately 50% fewer parameters. We further show SAP is effective on question answering and summarization. For the first time, our results demonstrate prompt-based learning is an emergent property of a broader class of language models, rather than only unidirectional models.",1
 Cycle-consistent Masked AutoEncoder for Unsupervised Domain Generalization,"Self-supervised learning methods undergo undesirable performance drops when there exists a significant domain gap between training and testing scenarios. Therefore, unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) is proposed to tackle the problem, which requires the model to be trained on several different domains without supervision and generalize well on unseen test domains. Existing methods either rely on a cross-domain and semantically consistent image pair in contrastive methods or the reconstruction pair in generative methods, while the precious image pairs are not available without semantic labels. In this paper, we propose a cycle cross-domain reconstruction task for unsupervised domain generalization in the absence of paired images. The cycle cross-domain reconstruction task converts a masked image from one domain to another domain and then reconstructs the original image from the converted images. To preserve the divergent domain knowledge of decoders in the cycle reconstruction task, we propose a novel domain-contrastive loss to regularize the domain information in reconstructed images encoded with the desirable domain style. Qualitative results on extensive datasets illustrate our method improves the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain generalization methods by average $\textbf{+5.59\%}, \textbf{+4.52\%}, \textbf{+4.22\%}, \textbf{+7.02\%}$ on $1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 100\%$ PACS, and $\textbf{+5.08\%}, \textbf{+6.49\%}, \textbf{+1.79\%}, \textbf{+0.53\%}$ on $1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 100\%$ DomainNet, respectively.",1
Neural Networks as Paths through the Space of Representations,"Deep neural networks implement a sequence of layer-by-layer operations that are each relatively easy to understand, but the resulting overall computation is generally difficult to understand. We develop a simple idea for interpreting the layer-by-layer construction of useful representations: the role of each layer is to reformat information to reduce the ""distance"" to the desired outputs. With this framework, the layer-wise computation implemented by a deep neural network can be viewed as a path through a high-dimensional representation space. We formalize this intuitive idea of a ""path"" by leveraging recent advances in metric representational similarity. We extend existing representational distance methods by computing geodesics, angles, and projections of representations, going beyond mere layer distances. We then demonstrate these tools by visualizing and comparing the paths taken by ResNet and VGG architectures on CIFAR-10. We conclude by sketching additional ways that this kind of representational geometry can be used to understand and interpret network training, to describe novel kinds of similarities between different models, and for representation-learning without backpropagation.",0
Subsampling in Large Graphs Using Ricci Curvature,"In the past decades, many large graphs with millions of nodes have been collected/constructed. The high computational cost and significant visualization difficulty hinder the analysis of large graphs. To overcome the difficulties, researchers have developed many graph subsampling approaches to provide a rough sketch that preserves global properties. By selecting representative nodes, these graph subsampling methods can help researchers estimate the graph statistics, e.g., the number of communities, of the large graph from the subsample. However, the available subsampling methods, e.g., degree node sampler and random walk sampler, tend to leave out minority communities because nodes with high degrees are more likely to be sampled. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods, we are motivated to apply the community information hidden in the graph to the subsampling method. Though the community structure is unavailable, community structure information can be obtained by applying geometric methods to a graph. An analog of Ricci curvature in the manifold is defined for the graph, i.e., Ollivier Ricci curvature. Based on the asymptotic results about the within-community edge and between-community edge's OR curvature, we propose a subsampling algorithm based on our theoretical results, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature Gradient-based subsampling (ORG-sub) algorithm. The proposed ORG-sub algorithm has two main contributions: First, ORG-sub provides a rigorous theoretical guarantee that the probability of ORG-sub taking all communities into the final subgraph converges to one. Second, extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm.",1
On the Existence of a Trojaned Twin Model,"We study the Trojan Attack problem, where malicious attackers sabotage deep
neural network models with poisoned training data. In most existing works, the
effectiveness of the attack is largely overlooked; many attacks can be ineffective
or inefficient for certain training schemes, e.g., adversarial training. In this paper,
we adopt a novel perspective and look into the quantitative relationship between a
clean model and its Trojaned counterpart. We formulate a successful attack using
classic machine learning language. Under mild assumptions, we show theoretically
that there exists a Trojaned model, named Trojaned Twin, that is very close to the
clean model. This attack can be achieved by simply using a universal Trojan trigger
intrinsic to the data distribution. This has powerful implications in practice; the
Trojaned twin model has enhanced attack efficacy and strong resiliency against
detection. Empirically, we show that our method achieves consistent attack efficacy
across different training schemes, including the challenging adversarial training
scheme. Furthermore, this Trojaned twin model is robust against SoTA
detection methods",0
Learning Latent Structural Causal Models,"Causal learning has long concerned itself with the accurate recovery of underlying causal mechanisms. Such causal modelling enables better explanations of out-of-distribution data. Prior works on causal learning assume that the high-level causal variables are given. However, in machine learning tasks, one often operates on low-level data like image pixels or high-dimensional vectors. In such settings, the entire Structural Causal Model (SCM) -- structure, parameters, \textit{and} high-level causal variables -- is unobserved and needs to be learnt from low-level data. We treat this problem as Bayesian inference of the latent SCM, given low-level data. For linear Gaussian additive noise SCMs, we present a tractable approximate inference method which performs joint inference over the causal variables, structure and parameters of the latent SCM from random, known interventions. Experiments are performed on synthetic datasets and a causally generated image dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We also perform image generation from unseen interventions, thereby verifying out of distribution generalization for the proposed causal model.",0
Expressive Monotonic Neural Networks,"The monotonic dependence of the outputs of a neural network on some of its inputs is a crucial inductive bias in many scenarios where domain knowledge dictates such behavior. This is especially important for interpretability and fairness considerations. In a broader context, scenarios in which monotonicity is important can be found in finance, medicine, physics, and other disciplines. It is thus desirable to build neural network architectures that implement this inductive bias provably. In this work, we propose a weight-constrained architecture with a single residual connection to achieve exact monotonic dependence in any subset of the inputs. The weight constraint scheme directly controls the Lipschitz constant of the neural network and thus provides the additional benefit of robustness. Compared to currently existing techniques used for monotonicity, our method is simpler in implementation and in theory foundations, has negligible computational overhead, is guaranteed to produce monotonic dependence, and is highly expressive. We show how the algorithm is used to train powerful, robust, and interpretable discriminators that achieve competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, from social applications to the classification of the decays of subatomic particles produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.",1
The Benefits of Model-Based Generalization in Reinforcement Learning,"Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely believed to have the potential to improve sample efficiency by allowing an agent to synthesize large amounts of imagined experience. Experience Replay (ER) can be considered a simple kind of model, which has proved extremely effective at improving the stability and efficiency of deep RL. In principle, a learned parametric model could improve on ER by generalizing from real experience to augment the dataset with additional plausible experience. However, owing to the many design choices involved in empirically successful algorithms, it can be very hard to establish where the benefits are actually coming from. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical insight into when, and how, we can expect data generated by a learned model to be useful. First, we provide a general theorem motivating how learning a model as an intermediate step can narrow down the set of possible value functions more than learning a value function directly from data using the Bellman equation.  Second, we provide an illustrative example showing empirically how a similar effect occurs in a more concrete setting with neural network function approximation.  Finally, we provide extensive experiments showing the benefit of model-based learning for online RL in environments with combinatorial complexity, but factored structure that allows a learned model to generalize. In these experiments, we take care to control for other factors in order to isolate, insofar as possible, the benefit of using experience generated by a learned model relative to ER alone.",0
Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers,"Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) $\textit{redundant experts}$ due to representational collapse; and (2) $\textit{poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning}$, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on $\textit{exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs}$ and leveraging it to effectively $\textbf{scale dense transformers}$. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, $\textbf{SMoE-Dropout}$, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a $\textit{randomly initialized and fixed}$ router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a $\textbf{``self-slimmable”}$ property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments across diverse transformer architectures on a variety of tasks demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {$1.03\%$, $0.78\%$, $1.09\%$} on challenging reasoning tasks {$\texttt{ASDiv-A}$, $\texttt{MAWPS}$, $\texttt{SVAMP}$}, respectively. Codes and models are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Random-MoE-as-Dropout.",1
The Modality Focusing Hypothesis: Towards Understanding Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation,"Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) extends traditional knowledge distillation to the area of multimodal learning and demonstrates great success in various applications. To achieve knowledge transfer across modalities, a pretrained network from one modality is adopted as the teacher to provide supervision signals to a student network learning from the other modality. In contrast to the empirical success reported in prior works, the working mechanism of crossmodal KD remains a mystery. In this paper, we present a thorough understanding of crossmodal KD. We begin by providing two failure cases and demonstrate that KD is not a universal cure in crossmodal knowledge transfer. We then present the modality Venn diagram to understand modality relationships and the modality focusing hypothesis revealing the decisive factor in the efficacy of crossmodal KD. Experimental results on 6 multimodal datasets help justify our hypothesis, diagnose failure cases, and point directions to improve crossmodal knowledge transfer in the future.",1
Advancing Radiograph Representation Learning with Masked Record Modeling,"Modern studies in radiograph representation learning (R$^2$L) rely on either self-supervision to encode invariant semantics or associated radiology reports to incorporate medical expertise, while the complementarity between them is barely noticed. To explore this, we formulate the self- and report-completion as two complementary objectives and present a unified framework based on masked record modeling (MRM). In practice, MRM reconstructs masked image patches and masked report tokens following a multi-task scheme to learn knowledge-enhanced semantic representations. With MRM pre-training, we obtain pre-trained models that can be well transferred to various radiography tasks. Specifically, we find that MRM offers superior performance in label-efficient fine-tuning. For instance, MRM achieves 88.5% mean AUC on CheXpert using 1% labeled data, outperforming previous R$^2$L methods with 100% labels. On NIH ChestX-ray, MRM outperforms the best performing counterpart by about 3% under small labeling ratios. Besides, MRM surpasses self- and report-supervised pre-training in identifying the pneumonia type and the pneumothorax area, sometimes by large margins.",1
FARE: Provably Fair Representation Learning,"Fair representation learning (FRL) is a popular class of methods aiming to produce fair classifiers via data preprocessing. However, recent work has shown that prior methods achieve worse accuracy-fairness tradeoffs than originally suggested by their results. This dictates the need for FRL methods that provide provable upper bounds on unfairness of any downstream classifier, a challenge yet unsolved. In this work we address this challenge and propose Fairness with Restricted Encoders (FARE), the first FRL method with provable fairness guarantees. Our key insight is that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables us to derive suitable fairness guarantees, while allowing empirical accuracy-fairness tradeoffs comparable to prior work. FARE instantiates this idea with a tree-based encoder, a choice motivated by inherent advantages of decision trees when applied in our setting. Crucially, we develop and apply a practical statistical procedure that computes a high-confidence upper bound on the unfairness of any downstream classifier. In our experimental evaluation on several datasets and settings we demonstrate that FARE produces tight upper bounds, often comparable with empirical results of prior methods, which establishes the practical value of our approach.

Untangling Effect and Side Effect: Consistent Causal Inference in Non-Targeted Trials,"A treatment is usually appropriate for some group (the ``sick"" group) on whom it has an effect, but it can also have a side-effect when given to subjects from another group (the ``healthy"" group). In a non-targeted trial both sick and healthy subjects may be treated, producing
heterogeneous effects within the treated group. Inferring the correct treatment effect on the sick population is then 
difficult, because the effect and side-effect are tangled. We propose an efficient nonparametric approach to untangling the effect and side-effect, called  PCM (pre-cluster and merge). We prove its asymptotic consistency in a general setting and
show, on synthetic data, 
more than a 10x improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-the-art.

A Non-monotonic Self-terminating Language Model,"Recent large-scale neural autoregressive sequence models have shown impressive performances on a variety of natural language generation tasks. However, their generated sequences often exhibit degenerate properties such as non-termination, undesirable repetition, and premature termination, when generated with decoding algorithms such as greedy search, beam search, top-$k$ sampling, and nucleus sampling. In this paper, we focus on the problem of non-terminating sequences resulting from an incomplete decoding algorithm. We first define an incomplete probable decoding algorithm which includes greedy search, top-$k$ sampling, and nucleus sampling, beyond the incomplete decoding algorithm originally put forward by Welleck et al. (2020). We then propose a non-monotonic self-terminating language model, which significantly relaxes the constraint of monotonically increasing termination probability in the originally proposed self-terminating language model by Welleck et al. (2020), to address the issue of non-terminating sequences when using incomplete probable decoding algorithms. We prove that our proposed model prevents non-terminating sequences when using not only incomplete probable decoding algorithms but also beam search. We empirically validate our model on sequence completion tasks with various architectures.",1
Minimum Variance Unbiased N:M Sparsity for the Neural Gradients,"In deep learning, fine-grained N:M sparsity reduces the data footprint and bandwidth of a General Matrix multiply (GEMM) up to x2,  and doubles throughput by skipping computation of zero values. So far, it was mainly only used to prune weights to accelerate the forward and backward phases. We examine how this method can be used also for the neural gradients (i.e. loss gradients with respect to the intermediate neural layer outputs). To this end, we first establish a tensor-level optimality criteria. Previous works aimed to minimize the mean-square-error (MSE) of each pruned block. We show that while minimization of the MSE works fine for pruning the weights and activations, it catastrophically fails for the neural gradients. Instead, we show that accurate pruning of the neural gradients requires an unbiased minimum-variance pruning mask. We design such specialized masks, and find that in most cases, 1:2 sparsity is sufficient for training, and 2:4 sparsity is usually enough when this is not the case. Further, we suggest combining several such methods together in order to potentially speed up training even more. A reference implementation is supplied in the supplementary material.",1
AANG : Automating Auxiliary Learning,"Auxiliary objectives, supplementary learning signals that are introduced to help aid learning on data-starved or highly complex end-tasks, are commonplace in machine learning. Whilst much work has been done to formulate useful auxiliary objectives, their construction is still an art which proceeds by slow and tedious hand-design. Intuition for how and when these objectives improve end-task performance has also had limited theoretical backing. In this work, we present an approach for automatically generating a suite of auxiliary objectives. We achieve this by deconstructing existing objectives within a novel unified taxonomy, identifying connections between them, and generating new ones based on the uncovered structure. Next, we theoretically formalize widely-held intuitions about how auxiliary learning improves generalization on the end-task. This leads us to a principled and efficient algorithm for searching the space of generated objectives to find those most useful to a specified end-task.
With natural language processing (NLP) as our domain of study, we demonstrate that our automated auxiliary learning pipeline leads to strong improvements over competitive baselines across continued training experiments on a pre-trained model on 5 NLP end-tasks.",1
A Stable and Scalable Method for Solving Initial Value PDEs with Neural Networks,"Unlike conventional grid and mesh based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs applicability to initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time; however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural-IVP, an ODE based IVP solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of challenging PDEs with neural networks.",1
Towards Robust Object Detection Invariant to Real-World Domain Shifts,"Safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving require robust object detection invariant to real-world domain shifts. Such shifts can be regarded as different domain styles, which can vary substantially due to environment changes and sensor noises, but deep models only know the training domain style. Such domain style gap impedes object detection generalization on diverse real-world domains. Existing classification domain generalization (DG) methods cannot effectively solve the robust object detection problem, because they either rely on multiple source domains with large style variance or destroy the content structures of the original images. In this paper, we analyze and investigate effective solutions to overcome domain style overfitting for robust object detection without the above shortcomings. Our method, dubbed as Normalization Perturbation (NP), perturbs the channel statistics of source domain low-level features to synthesize various latent styles, so that the trained deep model can perceive diverse potential domains and generalizes well even without observations of target domain data in training. This approach is motivated by the observation that feature channel statistics of the target domain images deviate around the source domain statistics. We further explore the style-sensitive channels for effective style synthesis. Normalization Perturbation only relies on a single source domain and is surprisingly simple and effective, contributing a practical solution by effectively adapting or generalizing classification DG methods to robust object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generalizing object detectors under real-world domain shifts.",1
Neural Causal Models for Counterfactual Identification and Estimation,"Evaluating hypothetical statements about how the world would be had a different course of action been taken is arguably one key capability expected from modern AI systems. Counterfactual reasoning underpins discussions in fairness, the determination of blame and responsibility, credit assignment, and regret. In this paper, we study the evaluation of counterfactual statements through neural models. Specifically, we tackle two causal problems required to make such evaluations, i.e., counterfactual identification and estimation from an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental data. First, we show that neural causal models (NCMs) are expressive enough and encode the structural constraints necessary for performing counterfactual reasoning. Second, we develop an algorithm for simultaneously identifying and estimating counterfactual distributions. We show that this algorithm is sound and complete for deciding counterfactual identification in general settings. Third, considering the practical implications of these results, we introduce a new strategy for modeling NCMs using generative adversarial networks. Simulations corroborate with the proposed methodology.",1
Moving Forward by Moving Backward: Embedding Action Impact over Action Semantics,"A common assumption when training embodied agents is that the impact of taking an action is stable; for instance, executing the ``move ahead'' action will always move the agent forward by a fixed distance, perhaps with some small amount of actuator-induced noise. This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings. By combining these latent action embeddings with a novel, transformer-based, policy head, we design an Action Adaptive Policy (AAP). We evaluate our AAP on two challenging visual navigation tasks in the AI2-THOR and Habitat environments and show that our AAP is highly performant even when faced, at inference-time, with missing actions and, previously unseen, perturbed action spaces. Moreover, we observe significant improvement in robustness against these actions when evaluating in real-world scenarios.",1
Multi-Layered 3D Garments Animation,"Most existing 3D garment animation datasets are restricted to human bodies with single-layered garments. Even though cases with upper shirts and lower pants are included, only a few overlap areas among such garment combinations exist. Moreover, they often regard human body movement as the only driving factor that causes garment animation. Approaches developed on top of these datasets thus tend to model garments as functions of human body parameters such as body shape and pose. While such treatment leads to promising performance on existing datasets, it leaves a gap between experimental environments and real scenarios, where a body can wear multiple layered garments and the corresponding garment dynamics can be affected by environmental factors and garment attributes. Consequently, existing approaches often struggle to generalize to multi-layered garments and realistic scenarios. To facilitate the advance of 3D garment animation toward handling more challenging cases, this paper presents a new large-scale synthetic dataset called LAYERS, covering 4,900 different combinations of multi-layered garments with 700k frames in total. The animation of these multi-layered garments follows the laws of physics and is affected by not only human body movements but also random environmental wind and garment attributes. To demonstrate the quality of LAYERS, we further propose a novel method, LayersNet, for 3D garment animation, which represents garments as unions of particles and subsequently adopts a neural network to animate garments via particle-based simulation. In this way, the interactions between different parts of one garment, different garments on the same body, and garments against various driving factors, can be naturally and uniformly handled via the interactions of particles. Through comprehensive experiments, LayersNet demonstrates superior performance in terms of animation accuracy and generality over baselines. The proposed dataset, LAYERS, as well as the proposed method, LayersNet, will be publicly available.",0
Learning Control Policies for Region Stabilization in Stochastic Systems,"We consider the problem of learning control policies in stochastic systems which guarantee that the system stabilizes within some specified stabilization region with probability 1. Our approach is based on the novel notion of stabilizing ranking supermartingales (sRSMs) that we introduce in this work. Our sRSMs overcome the limitation of methods proposed in previous works whose applicability is restricted to systems in which the stabilizing region cannot be left once entered under any control policy. We present a learning procedure that learns a control policy together with an sRSM that formally certifies probability 1 stability, both learned as neural networks. Our experimental evaluation shows that our learning procedure can successfully learn provably stabilizing policies in practice.",0
Many-Body Approximation for Tensors,"We propose a nonnegative tensor decomposition with focusing on the relationship between the modes of tensors. Traditional decomposition methods assume low-rankness in the representation, resulting in difficulties in global optimization and target rank selection. To address these problems, we present an alternative way to decompose tensors, a many-body approximation for tensors, based on an information geometric formulation. A tensor is treated via an energy-based model, where the tensor and its mode correspond to a probability distribution and a random variable, respectively, and many-body approximation is performed on it by taking the interaction between variables into account. Our model can be globally optimized in polynomial time in terms of the KL divergence minimization, which is empirically faster than low-rank approximations keeping comparable reconstruction error. Furthermore, we visualize interactions between modes as tensor networks and reveal a nontrivial relationship between many-body approximation and low-rank approximation.",0
Discovering Informative and Robust Positives for Video Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation for video recognition is challenging where the domain shift includes both spatial variations and temporal dynamics. Previous works have focused on exploring contrastive learning for cross-domain alignment. However, limited variations in intra-domain positives, false cross-domain positives, and false negatives hinder contrastive learning from fulfilling intra-domain discrimination and cross-domain closeness. This paper presents a non-contrastive learning framework without relying on negative samples for unsupervised video domain adaptation. To address the limited variations in intra-domain positives, we set unlabeled target videos as anchors and explored to mine ""informative intra-domain positives"" in the form of spatial/temporal augmentations and target nearest neighbors (NNs).
To tackle the false cross-domain positives led by noisy pseudo-labels, we reversely set source videos as anchors and sample the synthesized target videos as ""robust cross-domain positives"" from an estimated target distribution, which are naturally more robust to the pseudo-label noise. Our approach is demonstrated to be superior to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on several cross-domain action recognition benchmarks.

Lipschitz regularized gradient flows and latent generative particles,"Lipschitz regularized $f$-divergences are constructed by imposing a bound on the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator in the variational representation. These divergences interpolate between the Wasserstein metric and $f$-divergences and provide a flexible family of loss functions for non-absolutely continuous (e.g. empirical) distributions, possibly with heavy tails. We first construct Lipschitz regularized gradient flows on the space of probability measures based on these divergences. Examples of such gradient flows are Lipschitz regularized Fokker-Planck and porous medium partial differential equations (PDEs) for the Kullback-Leibler and $\alpha$-divergences, respectively. The regularization corresponds to imposing a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy numerical stability condition on the PDEs. For empirical measures, the Lipschitz regularization on gradient flows induces a numerically stable transporter/discriminator particle algorithm, where the generative particles are transported along the gradient of the discriminator. The gradient structure leads to a regularized Fisher information which is the total kinetic energy of the particles and can be used to track the convergence of the algorithm. The Lipschitz regularized discriminator can be implemented via neural network spectral normalization and the particle algorithm generates approximate samples from possibly high-dimensional distributions known only from data. Notably, our particle algorithm can generate synthetic data even in small sample size regimes. A new data processing inequality for the regularized divergence allows us to combine our particle algorithm with representation learning, e.g. autoencoder architectures. The resulting particle algorithm in latent space yields markedly improved generative properties in terms of efficiency and quality of the synthetic samples. From a statistical mechanics perspective the encoding can be interpreted dynamically as learning a better mobility for the generative particles. ",0
Transformers are Sample-Efficient World Models,"Deep reinforcement learning agents are notoriously sample inefficient, which considerably limits their application to real-world problems. Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search. To foster future research on Transformers and world models for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, we release our code and models at https://github.com/eloialonso/iris.",1
Generative Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted: An Unsupervised Image Denoising Network for Arbitrary Noise Distribution,"With the great breakthrough of supervised learning in the field of denoising, more and more works focus on end-to-end learning to train denoisers. The premise of this method is effective is that there is certain data support, but in practice, it is particularly difficult to obtain labels in the training data. To this end, some unsupervised denoisers have emerged in recent years, however, the premise of these methods being effective is that the noise model needs to be known in advance, which will limit the practical use of unsupervised denoising. In addition, inaccurate noise prior from noise estimation algorithms causes low denoising accuracy.  Therefore, we design a more practical denoiser that requires neither clean images as training labels nor noise model assumptions. Our method also needs the support of the noise model, the difference is that the model is generated by a residual image and a random mask during the network training process, and then the input and target of the network are generated from a single noisy images and the noise model, at the same time, train an unsupervised module and a pseudo supervised module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and even surpass the accuracy of supervised denoising.",0
Stochastic Constrained DRO with a Complexity Independent of Sample Size,"Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), as a popular method to train robust models against distribution shifts between training and test sets, has received tremendous attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose and analyze stochastic algorithms that apply to both non-convex and convex losses for solving Kullback–Leibler divergence constrained DRO problem. Compared with existing methods solving this problem, such as primal-dual methods and large mini-batch methods, our stochastic algorithms not only enjoy competitive if not better complexity independent of sample size but also just require a constant batch size at every iteration, which is more practical for broad applications. We establish a nearly optimal complexity bound for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution for non-convex losses and an optimal complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-optimal solution for convex losses. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for solving non-convex and convex constrained DRO problems. ",0
Learning differentiable solvers for systems with hard constraints,"We introduce a practical method to enforce partial differential equation (PDE) constraints for functions defined by neural networks (NNs), with a high degree of accuracy and up to a desired tolerance. We develop a differentiable PDE-constrained layer that can be incorporated into any NN architecture. Our method leverages differentiable optimization and the implicit function theorem to effectively enforce physical constraints. Inspired by dictionary learning, our model learns a family of functions, each of which defines a mapping from PDE parameters to PDE solutions. At inference time, the model finds an optimal linear combination of the functions in the learned family by solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem. Our method provides continuous solutions over the domain of interest that accurately satisfy desired physical constraints. Our results show that incorporating hard constraints directly into the NN architecture achieves much lower test error when compared to training on an unconstrained objective.",1
WikiWhy: Answering and Explaining Cause-and-Effect Questions,"As large language models (LLMs) grow larger and more sophisticated, assessing their ""reasoning"" capabilities in natural language grows more challenging. Recent question answering (QA) benchmarks that attempt to assess reasoning are often limited by a narrow scope of covered situations and subject matters. We introduce WikiWhy, a QA dataset built around a novel auxiliary task: explaining why an answer is true in natural language. WikiWhy contains over 9,000 ""why"" question-answer-rationale triples, grounded on Wikipedia facts across a diverse set of topics. Each rationale is a set of supporting statements connecting the question to the answer. WikiWhy serves as a benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous explicit rationales for each answer to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to be easily memorized. GPT-3 baselines achieve only 38.7% human-evaluated correctness in the end-to-end answer & explain condition, leaving significant room for future improvements.",1
RbX: Region-based explanations of prediction models,"We introduce region-based explanations (RbX), a novel, model-agnostic method to generate local explanations of scalar outputs from a black-box prediction model using only query access. RbX is based on a greedy algorithm for building a convex polytope that approximates a region of feature space where model predictions are close to the prediction at some target point. This region is fully specified by the user on the scale of the predictions, rather than on the scale of the features. The geometry of this polytope - specifically the change in each coordinate necessary to escape the polytope - quantifies the local sensitivity of the predictions to each of the features. These “escape distances” can then be standardized to rank the features by local importance. RbX is guaranteed to satisfy a “sparsity” axiom, which requires that features which do not enter into the prediction model are assigned zero importance. At the same time, real data examples and synthetic experiments show how RbX can more readily detect all locally relevant features than existing methods.",0
One Transformer Can Understand Both 2D & 3D Molecular Data,"Unlike vision and language data which usually has a unique format, molecules can naturally be characterized using different chemical formulations. One can view a molecule as a 2D graph or define it as a collection of atoms located in a 3D space. For molecular representation learning, most previous works designed neural networks only for a particular data format, making the learned models likely to fail for other data formats. We believe a general-purpose neural network model for chemistry should be able to handle molecular tasks across data modalities. To achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a novel Transformer-based Molecular model called Transformer-M, which can take molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture, Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled. By training on 2D and 3D molecular data with properly designed supervised signals, Transformer-M automatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and correctly capture the representations. We conducted extensive experiments for Transformer-M. All empirical results show that Transformer-M can simultaneously achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks, suggesting its broad applicability. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lsj2408/Transformer-M.",1
Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model,"Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) is a kind of powerful interpretable neural network, which utilizes high-level concepts to explain model decisions and interact with humans. However, CBM cannot always work as expected due to the troublesome collection and commonplace insufficiency of high-level concepts in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we theoretically reveal that insufficient concept information will induce the mixture of explicit and implicit information, which further leads to the inherent dilemma of concept and label distortions in CBM. Motivated by the proposed theorem, we present Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model (DCBM), a novel concept-based model decoupling heterogeneous information into explicit and implicit concepts, while still retaining high prediction performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments expose the success in the alleviation of concept/label distortions, where DCBM achieves state-of-the-art performances in both concept and label learning tasks. Especially for situations where concepts are insufficient, DCBM significantly outperforms other models based on concept bottleneck and respectively achieves error rates 24.95% and 20.09% lower than other CBMs on concept/label prediction. Moreover, to express effective human-machine interactions for DCBM, we devise two algorithms based on mutual information (MI) estimation, including forward intervention and backward rectification, which can automatically correct labels and trace back to wrong concepts. The construction of the interaction regime can be formulated as a light min-max optimization problem achieved within minutes. Multiple experiments show that such interactions can effectively promote concept/label accuracy.

A General Framework For Proving The Equivariant Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis,"The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) stipulates the existence of a subnetwork within a sufficiently overparameterized (dense) neural network that---when initialized randomly and without any training---achieves the accuracy of a fully trained target network. Recent works by Da Cunha et. al 2022, Burkholz 2022 demonstrate that the SLTH can be extended to translation equivariant networks---i.e. CNNs---with the same level of overparametrization as needed for the SLTs in dense networks. However, modern neural networks are capable of incorporating more than just translation symmetry, and developing general equivariant architectures such as rotation and permutation has been a powerful design principle. In this paper, we generalize the SLTH to functions that preserve the action of the group $G$---i.e. $G$-equivariant network---and prove, with high probability, that one can approximate any $G$-equivariant network of fixed width and depth by pruning a randomly initialized overparametrized $G$-equivariant network to a $G$-equivariant subnetwork. We further prove that our prescribed overparametrization scheme is optimal and provide a lower bound on the number of effective parameters as a function of the error tolerance. We develop our theory for a large range of groups, including subgroups of the Euclidean $\text{E}(2)$ and Symmetric group $G \leq \mathcal{S}_n$---allowing us to find SLTs for MLPs, CNNs, $\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, and permutation equivariant networks as specific instantiations of our unified framework. Empirically, we verify our theory by pruning overparametrized $\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, $k$-order GNNs, and message passing GNNs to match the performance of trained target networks.",1
Automated Data Augmentations for Graph Classification,"Data augmentations are effective in improving the invariance of learning machines. We argue that the core challenge of data augmentations lies in designing data transformations that preserve labels. This is relatively straightforward for images, but much more challenging for graphs. In this work, we propose GraphAug, a novel automated data augmentation method aiming at computing label-invariant augmentations for graph classification. Instead of using uniform transformations as in existing studies, GraphAug uses an automated augmentation model to avoid compromising critical label-related information of the graph, thereby producing label-invariant augmentations at most times. To ensure label-invariance, we develop a training method based on reinforcement learning to maximize an estimated label-invariance probability. Experiments show that GraphAug outperforms previous graph augmentation methods on various graph classification tasks.",1
Few-Shot Learning with Representative Global Prototype,"Few-shot learning is often challenged by low generalization performance due to the assumption that the data distribution of novel classes and base classes is similar while the model is trained only on the base classes. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a few-shot learning with representative global prototype method. Specifically, to enhance the generalization to novel classes, we propose a method to jointly train the base classes and the novel classes, using selected representative and non-representative samples to optimize representative global prototypes, respectively. Additionally, a method that organically combines the sample of base classes conditional on semantic embedding to generate new samples of novel classes with the original data is proposed to enhance the data of novel classes. Results show that this training method improves the model's ability to describe novel classes, improving the classification performance for a few shots. Intensive experiments have been conducted on two popular benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show that this method significantly improves the classification ability of few-shot learning tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
Simulating Environments for Evaluating Scarce Resource Allocation Policies,"Consider the sequential decision problem of allocating a limited supply of resources to a pool of potential recipients: This scarce resource allocation problem arises in a variety of settings characterized by ""hard-to-make"" tradeoffs– such as assigning organs to transplant patients, or rationing ventilators in overstretched ICUs. Assisting human judgement in these choices are dynamic allocation policies that prescribe how to match available assets to an evolving pool of beneficiaries– such as clinical guidelines that stipulate selection criteria on the basis of recipient and organ attributes. However, while such policies have received increasing attention in recent years, a key challenge lies in pre-deployment evaluation: How might allocation policies behave in the real world? In particular, in addition to conventional backtesting, it is crucial that policies be evaluated on a variety of possible scenarios and sensitivities– such as distributions of recipients and organs that may diverge from historic patterns. In this work, we present AllSim, an open-source framework for performing data-driven simulation of scarce resource allocation policies for pre-deployment evaluation. Simulation environments are modular (i.e. parameterized componentwise), learnable (i.e. on historical data), and customizable (i.e. to unseen conditions), and– upon interaction with a policy –outputs a dataset of simulated outcomes for analysis and benchmarking. Compared to existing work, we believe this approach takes a step towards more methodical evaluation of scarce resource allocation policies.",0
Crossformer: Transformer Utilizing Cross-Dimension Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"Recently many deep models have been proposed for multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. In particular, Transformer-based models have shown great potential because they can capture long-term dependency. However, existing Transformer-based models mainly focus on modeling the temporal dependency (cross-time dependency) yet often omit the dependency among different variables (cross-dimension dependency), which is critical for MTS forecasting. To fill the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting. In Crossformer, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention (TSA) layer is proposed to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing DSW embedding and TSA layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (HED) to use the information at different scales for the final forecasting. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show the effectiveness of Crossformer against previous state-of-the-arts.",1
Cascaded Teaching Transformers with Data Reweighting for Long Sequence Time-series Forecasting,"The Transformer-based models have shown superior performance in the long sequence time-series forecasting problem. The sparsity assumption on self-attention dot-product reveals that not all inputs are equally significant for Transformers. Instead of implicitly utilizing weighted time-series, we build a new learning framework by cascaded teaching Transformers to reweight samples. We formulate the framework as a multi-level optimization and design three different dataset-weight generators. We perform extensive experiments on five datasets, which shows that our proposed method could significantly outperform the SOTA Transformers.",0
Graph Neural Bandits,"Contextual bandits aim to choose the optimal arm with the highest reward out of a set of candidates based on their contextual information, and various bandit algorithms have been applied to personalized recommendation due to their ability of solving the exploitation-exploration dilemma. Motivated by online recommendation scenarios, in this paper, we propose a framework named Graph Neural Bandits (GNB) to leverage the collaborative nature among users empowered by graph neural networks (GNNs). Instead of estimating rigid user clusters, we model the ""fine-grained'' collaborative effects through estimated user graphs in terms of exploitation and exploration individually. Then, to refine the recommendation strategy, we utilize separate GNN-based models on estimated user graphs for exploitation and adaptive exploration. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on multiple real data sets in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",0
MMTSA: Multi-Modal Temporal Segment Attention Network for Efficient Human Activity Recognition,"Multimodal sensors (e.g., visual, non-visual, and wearable) provide complementary information to develop robust perception systems for recognizing activities. However, most existing algorithms use dense sampling and heterogeneous sub-network to extract unimodal features and fuse them at the end of their framework, which causes data redundancy, lack of multimodal complementary information and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new novel multi-modal neural architecture based on RGB and IMU wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) for human activity recognition called Multimodal Temporal Segment Attention Network (MMTSA). MMTSA first employs a multimodal data isomorphism mechanism based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and then applies a novel multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce redundancy. Moreover, we propose an inter-segment attention module in MMTSA to fuse multimodal features effectively and efficiently. We demonstrate the importance of imu data imaging and attention mechanism in human activity recognition by rigours evaluation on three public datasets, and achieved  superior improvements ($11.13\%$ on the MMAct dataset) than the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Asynchronous Gradient Play in Zero-Sum Multi-agent Games,"Finding equilibria via gradient play in competitive multi-agent games has been attracting a growing amount of attention in recent years, with emphasis on designing efficient strategies where the agents operate in a decentralized and symmetric manner with guaranteed convergence. While significant efforts have been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in zero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of gradient play open to questions. In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates (OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. The linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly delayed under mild statistical assumptions, albeit at a slower rate. Moving beyond random delays, we further demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU with two-timescale learning rates enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are arbitrarily bounded. Our methods also lead to finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix games under a wide range of delay assumptions.

Goal-Space Planning with Subgoal Models,"This paper investigates a new approach to model-based reinforcement learning using background planning: mixing (approximate) dynamic programming updates and model-free updates, similar to the Dyna architecture. Background planning with learned models is often worse than model-free alternatives, such as Double DQN, even though the former uses significantly more memory and computation. The fundamental problem is that learned models can be inaccurate and often generate invalid states, especially when iterated many steps. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by constraining background planning to a set of (abstract) subgoals and learning only local, subgoal-conditioned models. This goal-space planning (GSP) approach is more computationally efficient, naturally incorporates temporal abstraction for faster long-horizon planning and avoids learning the transition dynamics entirely. We show that our GSP algorithm can learn significantly faster than a Double DQN baseline in a variety of situations.",0
Phenaki: Variable Length Video Generation from Open Domain Textual Descriptions,"We present Phenaki, a model capable of realistic video synthesis given a sequence of textual prompts. Generating videos from text is particularly challenging due to the computational cost, limited quantities of high quality text-video data and variable length of videos. To address these issues, we introduce a new causal model for learning video representation which compresses the video to a small discrete tokens representation. This tokenizer is auto-regressive in time, which allows it to work with video representations of different length. 
To generate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated video tokens are subsequently de-tokenized to create the actual video. To address data issues, we demonstrate how joint training on a large corpus of image-text pairs as well as a smaller number of video-text examples can result in generalization beyond what is available in the video datasets. Compared to the previous video generation methods, Phenaki can generate arbitrary long videos conditioned on a sequence of prompts (i.e. time variable text or story) in open domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a paper studies generating videos from time variable prompts.",1
Filtered Semi-Markov CRF,"Semi-Markov CRF \citep{semicrf} has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional Linear Chain CRF\citep{crf} for text segmentation tasks such as Named Entity Recognition. In contrast to CRF, which treats text segmentation as token-level prediction, Semi-CRF considers spans as the task's basic unit, which makes it more expressive. However, Semi-CRF has two major drawbacks: (1) it has quadratic complexity over sequence length as it operates on every span of the input sequence, and (2) empirically, it performs worse than classical CRF for sequence labeling tasks such as NER. In our work, we propose Filtered Semi-Markov CRF, a Semi-CRF variant that addresses the aforementioned issues. Our model extends Semi-CRF by incorporating a filtering step for eliminating irrelevant segments, which helps in reducing the complexity and allows to dramatically reduce the search space. On a variety of NER benchmarks, we find that our approach outperforms both CRF and Semi-CRF models while being significantly faster. We will make our code available to the public. ",0
Artificial Replay: A Meta-Algorithm for Harnessing Historical Data in Bandits,"While standard bandit algorithms sometimes incur high regret, their performance can be greatly improved by ""warm starting"" with historical data. Unfortunately, how best to incorporate historical data is unclear: naively initializing reward estimates using all historical samples can suffer from spurious data and imbalanced data coverage, leading to computational and storage issues - particularly in continuous action spaces. We address these two challenges by proposing Artificial Replay, a meta-algorithm for incorporating historical data into any arbitrary base bandit algorithm. Artificial Replayuses only a subset of the historical data as needed to reduce computation and storage. We show that for a broad class of base algorithms that satisfy independence of irrelevant data (IIData), a novel property that we introduce, our method achieves equal regret as a full warm-start approach while potentially using only a fraction of historical data. We complement these theoretical results with a case study of $K$-armed and continuous combinatorial bandit algorithms, including on a green security domain using real poaching data, to show the practical benefits of Artificial Replayin achieving optimal regret alongside low computational and storage costs.",0
Benchmarking Constraint Inference in Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"When deploying Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents into a physical system, we must ensure that these agents are well aware of the underlying constraints. In many real-world problems, however, the constraints are often hard to specify mathematically and unknown to the RL agents. To tackle these issues, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) empirically estimates constraints from expert demonstrations. As an emerging research topic, ICRL does not have common benchmarks, and previous works tested algorithms under hand-crafted environments with manually-generated expert demonstrations. In this paper, we construct an ICRL benchmark in the context of RL application domains, including robot control, and autonomous driving. For each environment, we design relevant constraints and train expert agents to generate demonstration data. Besides, unlike existing baselines that learn a deterministic constraint, we propose a variational ICRL method to model a posterior distribution of candidate constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on these algorithms under our benchmark and show how they can facilitate studying important research challenges for ICRL. The benchmark, including the instructions for reproducing ICRL algorithms, is available at https://github.com/Guiliang/ICRL-benchmarks-public.",1
Retrieval-based Controllable Molecule Generation,"Generating new molecules with specified chemical and biological properties via generative models has emerged as a promising direction for drug discovery. However, existing methods require extensive training/fine-tuning with a large dataset, often unavailable in real-world generation tasks. In this work, we propose a new retrieval-based framework for controllable molecule generation. We use a small set of exemplar molecules,  i.e., those that (partially) satisfy the design criteria, to steer the pre-trained generative model towards synthesizing molecules that satisfy the given design criteria. We design a retrieval mechanism that retrieves and fuses the exemplar molecules with the input molecule, which is trained by a new self-supervised objective that predicts the nearest neighbor of the input molecule. We also propose an iterative refinement process to dynamically update the generated molecules and retrieval database for better generalization. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models and requires no task-specific fine-tuning. On various tasks ranging from simple design criteria to a challenging real-world scenario for designing lead compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we demonstrate our approach extrapolates well beyond the retrieval database, and achieves better performance and wider applicability than previous methods.",1
"Momentum Stiefel Optimizer, with Applications to Suitably-Orthogonal Attention, and Optimal Transport","The problem of optimization on Stiefel manifold, i.e., minimizing functions of (not necessarily square) matrices that satisfy orthogonality constraints, has been extensively studied. Yet, a new approach is proposed based on, for the first time, an interplay between thoughtfully designed continuous and discrete dynamics. It leads to a gradient-based optimizer with intrinsically added momentum. This method exactly preserves the manifold structure but does not require additional operation to keep momentum in the changing (co)tangent space, and thus has low computational cost and pleasant accuracy. Its generalization to adaptive learning rates is also demonstrated. Notable performances are observed in practical tasks. For instance, we found that placing orthogonal constraints on attention heads of trained-from-scratch Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) could markedly improve its performance, when our optimizer is used, and it is better that each head is made orthogonal within itself but not necessarily to other heads. This optimizer also makes the useful notion of Projection Robust Wasserstein Distance (Paty and Cuturi, 2019; Lin et al., 2020) for high-dim. optimal transport even more effective.",1
wav2tok: Deep Sequence Tokenizer for Audio Retrieval,"Search over audio sequences is a fundamental problem. In this paper, we propose a method to extract concise discrete representations for audio that can be used for efficient retrieval. Our motivation comes from orthography which represents speech of a given language in a concise and distinct discrete form. The proposed method, wav2tok, learns such representations for any kind of audio, speech or non-speech, from pairs of similar audio. wav2tok compresses the query and target sequences into shorter sequences of tokens that are faster to match. The learning method makes use of CTC loss and expectation-maximization algorithm, which are generally used for supervised automatic speech recognition and for learning discrete latent variables, respectively. Experiments show the consistent performance of wav2tok across two audio retrieval tasks: music search (query by humming) and speech search via audio query, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",1
On the Effectiveness of Out-of-Distribution Data in Self-Supervised Long-Tail Learning.,"Though Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely studied as a promising technique for representation learning, it doesn't generalize well on long-tailed datasets due to the majority classes dominating the feature space. Recent work shows that the long-tailed learning performance could be boosted by sampling extra in-domain (ID) data for self-supervised training, however, large-scale ID data which can rebalance the minority classes are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective solution, \textbf{C}ontrastive with \textbf{O}ut-of-distribution (OOD) data for \textbf{L}ong-\textbf{T}ail learning (COLT), which can effectively exploit OOD data to dynamically re-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive usefulness of OOD samples in SSL long-tailed learning and principally design a novel SSL method. Concretely, we first localize the `\emph{head}' and `\emph{tail}' samples by assigning a tailness score to each OOD sample based on its neighborhoods in the feature space. Then, we propose an online OOD sampling strategy to dynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be capable of distinguishing ID and OOD samples by a distribution-level supervised contrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and several state-of-the-art SSL frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our method significantly improves the performance of SSL on long-tailed datasets by a large margin, and even outperforms previous work which uses external ID data. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/JianhongBai/COLT}.",1
Outcome-directed Reinforcement Learning by Uncertainty \& Temporal Distance-Aware Curriculum Goal Generation,"Current reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers when solving a challenging exploration problem where the desired outcomes or high rewards are rarely observed. Even though curriculum RL, a framework that solves complex tasks by proposing a sequence of surrogate tasks, shows reasonable results, most of the previous works still have difficulty in proposing curriculum due to the absence of a mechanism for obtaining calibrated guidance to the desired outcome state without any prior domain knowledge. To alleviate it, we propose an uncertainty \& temporal distance-aware curriculum goal generation method for the outcome-directed RL via solving a bipartite matching problem. It could not only provide precisely calibrated guidance of the curriculum to the desired outcome states but also bring much better sample efficiency and geometry-agnostic curriculum goal proposal capability compared to previous curriculum RL methods. We demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms these prior methods in a variety of challenging navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks in a quantitative and qualitative way.",1
Riemannian Metric Learning via Optimal Transport,"We introduce an optimal transport-based model for learning a metric tensor from cross-sectional samples of evolving probability measures on a common Riemannian manifold. We neurally parametrize the metric as a spatially-varying matrix field and efficiently optimize our model's objective using a simple alternating scheme. Using this learned metric, we can non-linearly interpolate between probability measures and compute geodesics on the manifold. We show that metrics learned using our method improve the quality of trajectory inference on scRNA and bird migration data at the cost of little additional cross-sectional data.",1
Depth Separation with Multilayer Mean-Field Networks,"Depth separation—why a deeper network is more powerful than a shallow one—has been a major problem in deep learning theory. Previous results often focus on representation power, for example, Safran et al. (2019) constructed a function that is easy to approximate using a 3-layer network but not approximable by any 2-layer network. In this paper, we show that this separation is in fact algorithmic: one can learn the function constructed by Safran et al. (2019) using an overparametrized network with polynomially many neurons efﬁciently. Our result relies on a new way of extending the mean-ﬁeld limit to multilayer networks, and a decomposition of loss that factors out the error introduced by the discretization of inﬁnite-width mean-ﬁeld networks.",1
Modeling the Data-Generating Process is Necessary for Out-of-Distribution Generalization,"Recent empirical studies on domain generalization (DG) have shown that DG algorithms that perform well on some distribution shifts fail on others, and no state-of-the-art DG algorithm performs consistently well on all shifts. Moreover, real-world data often has multiple distribution shifts over different attributes; hence we introduce multi-attribute distribution shift datasets and find that the accuracy of existing DG algorithms falls even further. To explain these results, we provide a formal characterization of generalization under multi-attribute shifts using a canonical causal graph. Based on the relationship between spurious attributes and the classification label, we obtain realizations of the canonical causal graph that characterize common distribution shifts and show that each shift entails different independence constraints over observed variables. As a result, we prove that any algorithm based on a single, fixed constraint cannot work well across all shifts, providing theoretical evidence for mixed empirical results on DG algorithms. Based on this insight, we develop Causally Adaptive Constraint Minimization (CACM), an algorithm that uses knowledge about the data-generating process to adaptively identify and apply the correct independence constraints for regularization. Results on fully synthetic, MNIST, small NORB, and Waterbirds datasets, covering binary and multi-valued attributes and labels, show that adaptive dataset-dependent constraints lead to the highest accuracy on unseen domains whereas incorrect constraints fail to do so. Our results demonstrate the importance of modeling the causal relationships inherent in the data-generating process.",1
Simple and Scalable Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation,"$k$NN-MT is a straightforward yet powerful approach for fast domain adaptation, which directly plugs the pre-trained neural machine translation (NMT) models with domain-specific token-level $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) retrieval to achieve domain adaptation without retraining. Despite being conceptually attractive, $k$NN-MT is burdened with massive storage requirements and high computational complexity since it conducts nearest neighbor searches over the entire reference corpus. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable nearest neighbor machine translation framework to drastically promote the decoding and storage efficiency of $k$NN-based models while maintaining the translation performance. To this end, we dynamically construct a extremely small datastore for each input via sentence-level retrieval to avoid searching the entire datastore in vanilla $k$NN-MT, based on which we further introduce a distance-aware adapter to adaptively incorporate the $k$NN retrieval results into the pre-trained NMT models. Experiments on machine translation in two general settings, static domain adaptation, and online learning, demonstrate that our proposed approach not only achieves almost 90% speed as the NMT model without performance degradation, but also significantly reduces the storage requirements of $k$NN-MT.

Generative Augmented Flow Networks,"The Generative Flow Network is a probabilistic framework where an agent learns a stochastic policy for object generation, such that the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given reward function. Its effectiveness has been shown in discovering high-quality and diverse solutions, compared to reward-maximizing reinforcement learning-based methods. Nonetheless, GFlowNets only learn from rewards of the terminal states, which can limit its applicability. Indeed, intermediate rewards play a critical role in learning, for example from intrinsic motivation to provide intermediate feedback even in particularly challenging sparse reward tasks. Inspired by this, we propose Generative Augmented Flow Networks (GAFlowNets), a novel learning framework to incorporate intermediate rewards into GFlowNets. We specify intermediate rewards by intrinsic motivation to tackle the exploration problem in sparse reward environments. GAFlowNets can leverage edge-based and state-based intrinsic rewards in a joint way to improve exploration. Based on extensive experiments on the GridWorld task, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GAFlowNet in terms of convergence, performance, and diversity of solutions. We further show that GAFlowNet is scalable to a more complex and large-scale molecule generation domain, where it achieves consistent and significant performance improvement.",1
On the complexity of nonsmooth automatic differentiation,"Using the notion of conservative gradient, we provide a simple model to estimate the computational costs of the backward and forward modes of algorithmic differentiation for a wide class of nonsmooth programs. The complexity overhead of the backward mode turns out to be independent of the dimension when using programs with locally Lipschitz semi-algebraic or definable elementary functions. This extends considerably the Baur-Strassen's smooth cheap gradient principle. We illustrate our results by establishing fast backpropagation results of conservative gradients through feedforward neural networks with standard activation and  loss functions. Nonsmooth backpropagation's cheapness contrasts with concurrent forward approaches, which have, to this day, dimensional-dependent worst case  overhead estimates. We provide further results suggesting the superiority of backward propagation of conservative gradients. Indeed, we relate the complexity of computing a large number of directional derivatives to that of matrix multiplication, and we show that finding two subgradients in the Clarke subdifferential of a function is a NP-hard problem.",1
Efficient Federated Domain Translation ,"A central theme in federated learning (FL) is the fact that client data distributions are often not independent and identically distributed (IID), which has strong implications on the training process. While most existing FL algorithms focus on the conventional non-IID setting of class imbalance or missing classes across clients, in practice, the distribution differences could be more complex, e.g., changes in class conditional (domain) distributions. In this paper, we consider this complex case in FL wherein each client has access to only one domain distribution. For tasks such as domain generalization, most existing learning algorithms require access to data from multiple clients (i.e., from multiple domains) during training, which is prohibitive in FL. To address this challenge, we propose a federated domain translation method that generates pseudodata for each client which could be useful for multiple downstream learning tasks. We empirically demonstrate that our translation model is more resource-efficient (in terms of both communication and computation) and easier to train in an FL setting than standard domain translation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned translation model enables use of state-of-the-art domain generalization methods in a federated setting, which enhances accuracy and robustness to increases in the synchronization period compared to existing methodology.",1
Understanding Embodied Reference with Touch-Line Transformer,"We study embodied reference understanding, the task of locating referents using embodied gestural signals and language references. Human studies have revealed that, contrary to popular belief, objects referred to or pointed to do not lie on the elbow-wrist line, but rather on the so-called virtual touch line. Nevertheless, contemporary human pose representations lack the virtual touch line. To tackle this problem, we devise the touch-line Transformer: It takes as input tokenized visual and textual features and simultaneously predicts the referent’s bounding box and a touch-line vector. Leveraging this touch-line prior, we further devise a geometric consistency loss that promotes co-linearity between referents and touch lines. Using the touch line as gestural information dramatically improves model performances: Experiments on the YouRefIt dataset demonstrate that our method yields a +25.0% accuracy improvement under the 0.75 IoU criterion, hence closing 63.6% of the performance difference between models and humans. Furthermore, we computationally validate prior human studies by demonstrating that computational models more accurately locate referents when employing the virtual touch line than when using the elbow-wrist line.",1
Offline RL with No OOD Actions: In-Sample Learning via Implicit Value Regularization,"Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from the trade-off between improving the policy to surpass the behavior policy and constraining the policy to limit the deviation from the behavior policy as computing $Q$-values using out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will suffer from errors due to distributional shift. The recent proposed \textit{In-sample Learning} paradigm (i.e., IQL), which improves the policy by quantile regression using only data samples, shows great promise because it learns an optimal policy without querying the value function of any unseen actions. However, it remains unclear how this type of method handles the distributional shift in learning the value function. In this work, we make a key finding that the in-sample learning paradigm arises under the \textit{Implicit Value Regularization} (IVR) framework. This gives a deeper understanding of why the in-sample learning paradigm works, i.e., it applies implicit value regularization to the policy. Based on the IVR framework, we further propose two practical algorithms, Sparse $Q$-learning (SQL) and Exponential $Q$-learning (EQL), which adopt the same value regularization used in existing works, but in a complete in-sample manner. Compared with IQL, we find that our algorithms introduce sparsity in learning the value function, making them more robust in noisy data regimes. We also verify the effectiveness of SQL and EQL on D4RL benchmark datasets and show the benefits of in-sample learning by comparing them with CQL in small data regimes. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ryanxhr/SQL}.",1
Learning to Solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems with Recurrent Transformer,"Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are about finding values of variables that satisfy the given constraints. We show that Transformer extended with recurrence is a viable approach to learning to solve CSPs in an end-to-end manner, having clear advantages over state-of-the-art methods such as Graph Neural Networks, SATNet, and some neuro-symbolic models. With the ability of Transformer to handle visual input, the proposed Recurrent Transformer can straightforwardly be applied to visual constraint reasoning problems while successfully addressing the symbol grounding problem. We also show how to leverage deductive knowledge of discrete constraints in the Transformer's inductive learning to achieve sample-efficient learning and semi-supervised learning for CSPs.",1
Are More Layers Beneficial to Graph Transformers?,"Despite that going deep has proven successful in many neural architectures, the existing graph transformers are relatively shallow. In this work, we explore whether more layers are beneficial to graph transformers, and find that current graph transformers suffer from the bottleneck of improving performance by increasing depth. Our further analysis reveals the reason is that deep graph transformers are limited by the vanishing capacity of global attention, restricting the graph transformer from focusing on the critical substructure and obtaining expressive features. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer model named DeepGraph that explicitly employs substructure tokens in the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to obtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the graph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth limitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance across various graph benchmarks with deeper models.",1
REVISITING PRUNING AT INITIALIZATION THROUGH THE LENS OF RAMANUJAN GRAPH,"Pruning neural networks at initialization (PaI) has received an upsurge of interest due to its end-to-end saving potential. PaI is able to find sparse subnetworks at initialization that can achieve comparable performance to the full networks. These methods can surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to post-training pruning. Previous approaches firmly rely on weights, gradients, and sanity checks as primary signals when conducting PaI analysis. To better understand the underlying mechanism of PaI, we propose to interpret it through the lens of the Ramanujan Graph - a class of expander graphs that are sparse while being highly connected. It is often believed there should be a strong correlation between the Ramanujan graph and PaI since both are about finding sparse and well-connected neural networks. However, the finer-grained link relating highly sparse and connected networks to their relative performance (i.e., ranking of difference sparse structures at the same specific global sparsity) is still missing. We observe that not only the Ramanujan property for sparse networks shows no significant relationship to PaI’s relative performance, but maximizing it can also lead to the formation of pseudo-random graphs with no structural meanings. We reveal the underlying cause to be Ramanujan Graph’s strong assumption on the upper bound of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue (µˆ) of layers belonging to highly sparse networks. We hence propose Iterative Mean Difference of Bound (IMDB) as a mean to relax the µˆ upper bound. Likewise, we also show there exists a lower bound for µˆ, which we call the Normalized Random Coefficient (NaRC), that gives us an accurate assessment for when sparse but highly connected structure degenerates into naive randomness. Finally, we systematically analyze the behavior of various PaI methods and demonstrate the utility of our proposed metrics in characterizing PaI performance. We show that subnetworks preserving better the IMDB property correlate higher in performance, while NaRC provides us with a possible mean to locate the region where highly connected, highly sparse, and non-trivial Ramanujan expanders exist. Our code is available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/ramanujan-on-pai.",1
Learning to reason over visual objects,"A core component of human intelligence is the ability to identify abstract patterns inherent in complex, high-dimensional perceptual data, as exemplified by visual reasoning tasks such as Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Motivated by the goal of designing AI systems with this capacity, recent work has focused on evaluating whether neural networks can learn to solve RPM-like problems. Previous work has generally found that strong performance on these problems requires the incorporation of inductive biases that are specific to the RPM problem format, raising the question of whether such models might be more broadly useful. Here, we investigated the extent to which a general-purpose mechanism for processing visual scenes in terms of objects might help promote abstract visual reasoning. We found that a simple model, consisting only of an object-centric encoder and a transformer reasoning module, achieved state-of-the-art results on both of two challenging RPM-like benchmarks (PGM and I-RAVEN), as well as a novel benchmark with greater visual complexity (CLEVR-Matrices). These results suggest that an inductive bias for object-centric processing may be a key component of abstract visual reasoning, obviating the need for problem-specific inductive biases.",1
Adversarial Diversity in Hanabi,"Many Dec-POMDPs admit a qualitatively diverse set of ''reasonable'' joint policies, where reasonableness is indicated by symmetry equivariance, non-sabotaging behaviour and the graceful degradation of performance when paired with ad-hoc partners. Some of the work in diversity literature is concerned with generating these policies. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to produce teams of agents that are simultaneously diverse, high performing, and reasonable. In this work, we propose a novel approach, adversarial diversity (ADVERSITY), which is designed for turn-based Dec-POMDPs with public actions. ADVERSITY relies on off-belief learning to encourage reasonableness and skill, and on ''repulsive'' fictitious transitions to encourage diversity. We use this approach to generate new agents with distinct but reasonable play styles for the card game Hanabi and open-source our agents to be used for future research on (ad-hoc) coordination.",1
GFlowNets and variational inference,"This paper builds bridges between two families of probabilistic algorithms: (hierarchical) variational inference (VI), which is typically used to model distributions over continuous spaces, and generative flow networks (GFlowNets), which have been used for distributions over discrete structures such as graphs. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, VI algorithms are equivalent to special cases of GFlowNets in the sense of equality of expected gradients of their learning objectives. We then point out the differences between the two families and show how these differences emerge experimentally. Notably, GFlowNets, which borrow ideas from reinforcement learning, are more amenable than VI to off-policy training without the cost of high gradient variance induced by importance sampling. We argue that this property of GFlowNets can provide advantages for capturing diversity in multimodal target distributions. Code: https://github.com/GFNOrg/GFN_vs_HVI.",1
Meta-Learning in Games,"In the literature on game-theoretic equilibrium finding, focus has mainly been on solving a single game in isolation. In practice, however, strategic interactions—ranging from routing problems to online advertising auctions—evolve dynamically, thereby leading to many similar games to be solved. To address this gap, we introduce meta-learning for equilibrium finding and learning to play games. We establish the first meta-learning guarantees for a variety of fundamental and well-studied games, including two-player zero-sum games, general-sum games, Stackelberg games, and multiple extensions thereof. In particular, we obtain rates of convergence to different game-theoretic equilibria that depend on natural notions of similarity between the sequence of games encountered, while at the same time recovering the known single-game guarantees when the sequence of games is arbitrary. Along the way, we prove a number of new results in the single-game regime through a simple and unified framework, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate our meta-learning algorithms on endgames faced by the poker agent Libratus against top human professionals. The experiments show that games with varying stack sizes can be solved significantly faster using our meta-learning techniques than by solving them separately, often by an order of magnitude.",1
Understanding weight-magnitude hyperparameters in training binary networks,"Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are compact and efficient by using binary weights instead of real-valued weights. Current BNNs use latent real-valued weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs, however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay, which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay, which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary weights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for improved accuracy.

When Source-Free Domain Adaptation Meets Learning with Noisy Labels,"Recent state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have focused on learning meaningful cluster structures in the feature space, which have succeeded in adapting the knowledge from source domain to unlabeled target domain without accessing the private source data. However, existing methods rely on the pseudo-labels generated by source models that can be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we study SFDA from the perspective of learning with label noise (LLN). Unlike the label noise in the conventional LLN scenario, we prove that the label noise in SFDA follows a different distribution assumption. We also prove that such a difference makes existing LLN methods that rely on their distribution assumptions unable to address the label noise in SFDA. Empirical evidence suggests that only marginal improvements are achieved when applying the existing LLN methods to solve the SFDA problem. On the other hand, although there exists a fundamental difference between the label noise in the two scenarios, we demonstrate theoretically that the early-time training phenomenon (ETP), which has been previously observed in conventional label noise settings, can also be observed in the SFDA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements to existing SFDA algorithms by leveraging ETP to address the label noise in SFDA.",1
The In-Sample Softmax for Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can leverage batches of previously collected data to extract a reasonable control policy. An emerging issue in this offline RL setting, however, is that the bootstrapping update underlying many of our methods suffers from insufficient action-coverage: standard max operator may select a maximal action that has not been seen in the dataset. Bootstrapping from these inaccurate values can lead to overestimation and even divergence. There are a growing number of methods that attempt to approximate an in-sample max, that only uses actions well-covered by the dataset. We highlight a simple fact: it is more straightforward to approximate an in-sample softmax using only actions in the dataset. We show that policy iteration based on the in-sample softmax converges, and that for decreasing temperatures it approaches the in-sample max. We derive an In-Sample Actor-Critic (AC), using this in-sample softmax, and show that it is consistently better or comparable to existing offline RL methods, and is also well-suited to fine-tuning. We release the code at github.com/hwang-ua/inac_pytorch.",1
Selective Frequency Network for Image Restoration,"Image restoration aims to reconstruct the latent sharp image from its corrupted counterpart. Besides dealing with this long-standing task in the spatial domain, a few approaches seek solutions in the frequency domain in consideration of the large discrepancy between spectra of sharp/degraded image pairs. However, these works commonly utilize transformation tools, e.g., wavelet transform, to split features into several frequency parts, which is not flexible enough to select the most informative frequency component to recover. In this paper, we exploit a multi-branch and content-aware module to decompose features into separate frequency subbands dynamically and locally, and then accentuate the useful ones via channel-wise attention weights. In addition, to handle large-scale degradation blurs, we propose an extremely simple decoupling and modulation module to enlarge the receptive field via global and window-based average pooling. Integrating two developed modules into a U-Net backbone, the proposed Selective Frequency Network (SFNet) performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on five image restoration tasks, including single-image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, image motion deblurring, image desnowing, and image deraining.",1
MEDICAL IMAGE UNDERSTANDING WITH PRETRAINED VISION LANGUAGE MODELS: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY,"The large-scale pre-trained vision language models (VLM) have shown remarkable domain transfer capability on natural images. However, it remains unknown whether this capability can also apply to the medical image domain. This paper thoroughly studies the knowledge transferability of pre-trained VLMs to the medical domain, where we show that well-designed medical prompts are the key to elicit knowledge from pre-trained VLMs. We demonstrate that by prompting with expressive attributes that are shared between domains, the VLM can carry the knowledge across domains and improve its generalization. This mechanism empowers VLMs to recognize novel objects with fewer or without image samples. Furthermore, to avoid the laborious manual designing process, we develop three approaches for automatic generation of medical prompts, which can inject expert-level medical knowledge and image-specific information into the prompts for fine-grained grounding. We conduct extensive experiments on thirteen different medical datasets across various modalities, showing that our well-designed prompts greatly improve the zero-shot performance compared to the default prompts, and our fine-tuned models surpass the supervised models by a significant margin.",1
Protein Representation Learning by Geometric Structure Pretraining,"Learning effective protein representations is critical in a variety of tasks in biology such as predicting protein function or structure. Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. Despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their 3D structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder to learn the geometric features of a protein. We pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/GearNet.",1
Factorized Fourier Neural Operators,"We propose the Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (F-FNO), a learning-based approach for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). Starting from a recently proposed Fourier representation of flow fields, the F-FNO bridges the performance gap between pure machine learning approaches to that of the best numerical or hybrid solvers. This is achieved with new representations – separable spectral layers and improved residual connections – and a combination of training strategies such as the Markov assumption, Gaussian noise, and cosine learning rate decay. On several challenging benchmark PDEs on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds, the F-FNO can scale to deeper networks and outperform both the FNO and the geo-FNO, reducing the error by 83% on the Navier-Stokes problem, 31% on the elasticity problem, 57% on the airfoil flow problem, and 60% on the plastic forging problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art pseudo-spectral method, the F-FNO can take a step size that is an order of magnitude larger in time and achieve an order of magnitude speedup to produce the same solution quality.",1
Variance-Aware Sparse Linear Bandits,"It is well-known that for sparse linear bandits, when ignoring the dependency on sparsity which is much smaller than the ambient dimension, the worst-case minimax regret is $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\sqrt{dT}\right)$ where $d$ is the ambient dimension and $T$ is the number of rounds. On the other hand, in the benign setting where there is no noise and the action set is the unit sphere, one can use divide-and-conquer to achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(1)$ regret, which is (nearly) independent of $d$ and $T$. In this paper, we present the first variance-aware regret guarantee for sparse linear bandits:  $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left(\sqrt{d\sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2} + 1\right)$, where $\sigma_t^2$ is the variance of the noise at the $t$-th round. This bound naturally interpolates the regret bounds for the worst-case constant-variance regime (i.e., $\sigma_t \equiv \Omega(1)$) and the benign deterministic regimes (i.e., $\sigma_t \equiv 0$). To achieve this variance-aware regret guarantee, we develop a general framework that converts any variance-aware linear bandit algorithm to a variance-aware algorithm for sparse linear bandits in a ""black-box"" manner. Specifically, we take two recent algorithms as black boxes to illustrate that the claimed bounds indeed hold, where the first algorithm can handle unknown-variance cases and the second one is more efficient.",1
OPTQ: Accurate Quantization for Generative Pre-trained Transformers,"Generative Pre-trained Transformer models, known as GPT or OPT, set themselves apart through breakthrough performance across complex language modelling tasks, but also by their extremely high computational and storage costs. Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose OPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, OPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels.
We show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000). The implementation is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/gptq.",1
Pre-training via Denoising for Molecular Property Prediction,"Many important problems involving molecular property prediction from 3D structures have limited data, posing a generalization challenge for neural networks. In this paper, we describe a pre-training technique based on denoising that achieves a new state-of-the-art in molecular property prediction by utilizing large datasets of 3D molecular structures at equilibrium to learn meaningful representations for downstream tasks. Relying on the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching, we show that the denoising objective corresponds to learning a molecular force field -- arising from approximating the Boltzmann distribution with a mixture of Gaussians -- directly from equilibrium structures. Our experiments demonstrate that using this pre-training objective significantly improves performance on multiple benchmarks, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the majority of targets in the widely used QM9 dataset. Our analysis then provides practical insights into the effects of different factors -- dataset sizes, model size and architecture, and the choice of upstream and downstream datasets -- on pre-training.",1
Revisit Finetuning strategy for Few-Shot Learning to Transfer the Emdeddings,"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to learn a simple and effective bias on limited novel samples. Recently, many methods have been focused on re-training a randomly initialized linear classifier to adapt it to the novel features extracted by the pre-trained feature extractor (called Linear-Probing-based methods). These methods typically assumed the pre-trained feature extractor was robust enough, i.e., finetuning was not needed, and hence the pre-trained feature extractor does not change on the novel samples. However, the unchanged pre-trained feature extractor will distort the features of novel samples because the robustness assumption may not hold, especially on the out-of-distribution samples. To extract the undistorted features, we designed Linear-Probing-Finetuning with Firth-Bias (LP-FT-FB) to yield an accurate bias on the limited samples for better finetuning the pre-trained feature extractor, providing stronger transferring ability. In LP-FT-FB, we further proposed inverse Firth Bias Reduction (i-FBR) to regularize the over-parameterized feature extractor on which FBR does not work well.	The proposed i-FBR effectively alleviates the over-fitting problem of the feature extractor in the process of finetuning and helps extract undistorted novel features. To show the effectiveness of the designed LP-FT-FB, we conducted a lot of experiments on the commonly used FSL datasets under different backbones, including in-domain and cross-domain FSL tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed FT-LP-FB outperforms the SOTA FSL methods. The code is available at https://github.com/whzyf951620/LinearProbingFinetuningFirthBias.",1
PAC-NeRF: Physics Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Fields for Geometry-Agnostic System Identification,"Existing approaches to system identification (estimating the physical parameters of an object) from videos assume known object geometries. This precludes their applicability in a vast majority of scenes where object geometries are complex or unknown. In this work, we aim to identify parameters characterizing a physical system from a set of multi-view videos without any assumption on object geometry or topology. To this end, we propose ""Physics Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Fields"" (PAC-NeRF), to estimate both the unknown geometry and physical parameters of highly dynamic objects from multi-view videos. We design PAC-NeRF to only ever produce physically plausible states by enforcing the neural radiance field to follow the conservation laws of continuum mechanics. For this, we design a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation of the neural radiance field, i.e., we use the Eulerian grid representation for NeRF density and color fields, while advecting the neural radiance fields via Lagrangian particles. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation seamlessly blends efficient neural rendering with the material point method (MPM) for robust differentiable physics simulation. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on geometry and physical parameter estimation over a vast range of materials, including elastic bodies, plasticine, sand, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and demonstrate significant performance gain on most tasks.",1
On the Perils of Cascading Robust Classifiers,"Ensembling certifiably robust neural networks is a promising approach for improving the \emph{certified robust accuracy} of neural models. 
Black-box ensembles that assume only query-access to the constituent models (and their robustness certifiers) during prediction are particularly attractive due to their modular structure. Cascading ensembles are a popular instance of black-box ensembles that appear to improve certified robust accuracies in practice. However, we show that the robustness certifier used by a cascading ensemble is unsound. That is, when a cascading ensemble is certified as locally robust at an input $x$ (with respect to $\epsilon$), there can be inputs $x'$ in the $\epsilon$-ball centered at $x$, such that the cascade's prediction at $x'$ is different from $x$ and thus the ensemble is not locally robust. Our theoretical findings are accompanied by empirical results that further demonstrate this unsoundness. We present a new attack against cascading ensembles and show that: (1) there exists an adversarial input for up to 88\% of the samples where the ensemble claims to be certifiably robust and accurate; and (2) the accuracy of a cascading ensemble under our attack is as low as 11\% when it claims to be certifiably robust and accurate on 97\% of the test set. Our work reveals a critical pitfall of cascading certifiably robust models by showing that the seemingly beneficial strategy of cascading can actually hurt the robustness of the resulting ensemble. Our code is available at https://github.com/TristaChi/ensembleKW.",1
Scenario-based Question Answering with Interacting Contextual Properties,"In the scenario-based Question Answering (QA) task, models are asked to find answers that are appropriate to the user scenarios associated with the question and identify information that is missing from the scenarios but is necessary for the answers to hold. Scenarios commonly include multiple properties of users, such as age, employment status, and income level for the question “How much can I claim from this benefit”. The properties relevant to a potential answer are given in a document, which will state conditions necessary for the answer to hold. Documents also may specify how conditions interact with each other, e.g. with text like “one of the conditions below must apply”. Although understanding the relationship between conditions is crucial for solving this challenging QA task, limited work has been done so far in modeling this. In this paper, we propose the T-Reasoner model, which solves this problem with three jointly learned modules: an entailment module which checks whether a condition has been satisfied by the scenario, a decoding module which locates eligible answers from documents, and a reasoning module which infers the relationship between conditions and performs a reasoning step to determine the logically consistent answers and identify missing conditions. T-Reasoner outperforms strong baselines on a synthetic scenario-based QA dataset and achieves a new state-of-the-art on two scenario-based QA benchmarks, outperforming the prior best models by 3-10 points.",1
WiNeRT: Towards Neural Ray Tracing for Wireless Channel Modelling and Differentiable Simulations,"In this paper, we work towards a neural surrogate to model wireless electro-magnetic propagation effects in indoor environments.
Such neural surrogates provide a fast, differentiable, and continuous representation of the environment and enables end-to-end optimization for downstream tasks (e.g., network planning). Specifically, the goal of the paper is to render the wireless signal (e.g., time-of-flights, power of each path) in an environment as a function of the sensor's spatial configuration (e.g., placement of transmit and receive antennas). NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results in the visual setting (RGB image signal, with a camera sensor), where the key idea is to algorithmically evaluate the 'global' signal (e.g., using volumetric rendering) by breaking it down in a sequence of 'local' evaluations (e.g., using co-ordinate neural networks). In a similar spirit, we model the time-angle channel impulse response (the global wireless signal) as a superposition of multiple paths. The wireless characteristics (e.g., power) of each path is a result of multiple evaluations of a neural network that learns implicit ray-surface interaction properties. We evaluate our approach in multiple indoor scenarios and demonstrate that our model achieves strong performance (e.g., $<$0.33ns error in time-of-flight predictions). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our neural surrogate whitens the `black-box' wireless simulators, and thus enables inverse rendering applications (e.g., user localization).",1
