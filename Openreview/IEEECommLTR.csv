ris-assisted full duplex communication using zs-bf and signal alignment technique,"Reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted full duplex (RIS-FD) communication is attracting attention because of its ability to solve the issue of spectrum crunch and improve signal strength in shadowing areas. However, its potential has not been exploited due to various interferences, like self-interference and loop-interference. This letter proposes a RIS-FD communication where the loop interference is mitigated by employing a zero steering beamforming (ZS-BF) technique. The proposed scheme also becomes effective by partitioning the single RIS into two parts to support simultaneous uplink and downlink communications. Additionally, the system has been examined under imperfect channel state information to make it more practical. Further, the closed-form analytical expressions of the outage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency are derived for the proposed scheme, as well as corroborated with simulation results. The comparative analysis and its results show that the proposed scheme yields superior outcomes compared to the existing work in the literature."
ergodic capacity of multi-tag ambient backscatter systems with hardware impairments,"This letter investigates the ergodic capacity of an ambient backscatter system (AmBS) that comprises an ambient source, a reader, and multiple tags under radio-frequency hardware impairments (RFHIs). The considered AmBS adopts a multi-tag selection scheme where a selected tag backscatters the ambient source’s RF signals to communicate with the reader. We assume that the ambient source and reader are fabricated using a low-cost hardware that results in residual RFHIs at these nodes. For this setup, we derive an accurate ergodic capacity expression by considering Nakagami- ${m}$ fading channels. We present numerical analysis to unveil the associated system performance gains."
meta supervised contrastive learning for few-shot open-set modulation classification with signal constellation,"In this work, we introduce a method for few-shot open-set modulation classification utilizing signal constellation diagrams, based on a Meta Supervised Contrastive Learning (MSCL) algorithm. MSCL combines the strengths of supervised contrastive learning and meta-learning to effectively amplify inter-class distinctions and reinforce intra-class compactness. The experimental results demonstrate that MSCL exhibits superior performance in both few-shot and open-set Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) recognition.

gambling on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces,"We consider multi-operator wireless networks where broadband reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) effectively cover the transmission bands of all operators. These RISs are supplied by a dedicated provider and dynamically leased on-demand to individual operators to support their transmissions. When an operator takes control of a RIS, it can adjust its phase-response to meet the requirements of its users. This sets the stage for a competitive scenario where operators vie for control of RISs. To address this competition, we introduce an auction format designed to efficiently allocate RISs to operators. Furthermore, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment to optimize operators’ bidding strategies, demonstrating its superiority over the heuristic dominant strategy of greedy bidding."
error probability of shadowed uav-to-ground channels with phase noise,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground communication channels have been the focus of much research lately. This has led to the appearance of new UAV-to-ground channel models in the literature that incorporate both fading and shadowing. In this letter, we provide the mathematical framework for UAV-to-ground communications with imperfect phase recovery using these new channel models. This phase error can be mathematically modeled by Tikhonov and Gaussian distributions. We have obtained mathematical expressions in closed-form for calculating the average bit error rate (ABER) for both binary and quadrature phase-shift keying signals in addition to the average symbol error rate (ASER) for $M$ -ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) modulations under phase noise. Then, these expressions are validated by Monte Carlo simulations."
polar coded power domain non-orthogonal multiple access system: construction and optimization,"The generalized polarization phenomenon exists in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This letter specifically focuses on two-user coding-NOMA systems, which provide a practical joint optimization solution for next-generation mobile communication. In this letter, we employ the finite code length normal approximation bound to establish the connection among error probabilities, power allocation, and code rate allocation in coding-NOMA systems. First, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize error probability, and another one to maximize energy efficiency under a given system error performance for practical scenarios. Then, we derive the relationship between optimal code rates and powers, and then compute suitable power scheme using an iterative algorithm. Finally, we optimize polar coded NOMA systems using polarization subchannels. The proposed optimization scheme exhibits only a 0.5dB deviation from the normal approximation bound at a block error rate of 10−3. Furthermore, the polar coded NOMA scheme outperforms low-density parity-check code (LDPC) coding."
learning-aided uav-cooperation reduces the age-of-information in wireless networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can enhance data collection for ground sensing nodes (SNs). Given the modest battery capacity of UAVs and the limited communication range of SNs, it is crucial to conceive efficient trajectory coordination for UAVs. However, existing studies simply decouple the joint trajectory planning policy of multiple UAVs into independent local policies, preventing their cooperation and hence limits the performance. Inspired by the observation that sharing messages among agents can promote their cooperation, we investigate the communication-assisted decentralized trajectory planning policy of multi-UAV wireless networks. Our goal is to minimize the overall energy consumption of UAVs and the average age of information of all SNs. To harness the encoded messages for learning a sophisticated policy, we conceive a communication-assisted distributed training and execution framework, and propose a communication-aided decentralized trajectory control algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning based methods, at a modest communication overhead."
coding-enhanced cooperative jamming for secret communication in fluid antenna systems,"This letter investigates the secret communication problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the legitimate transmitter transmits an information-bearing signal to the legitimate receiver, and at the same time, transmits a jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike the conventional jamming scheme, which usually transmits Gaussian noise that interferes not only with Eve but also with the legitimate receiver, in this letter, we consider that encoded codewords are transmitted to jam Eve. Then, by employing appropriate coding schemes, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the jamming signal and then cancel the interference, while Eve cannot, even if it knows the codebooks. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate through port selection and power control. Although the problem is non-convex, we show that the optimal solution can be found. Simulation results show that by using the FAS technique and the proposed jamming scheme, the secrecy rate of the system can be significantly increased."
irs-aided received signal strength localization using a wireless sensor network,"In this letter, we initially present a formulation of Received Signal Strengths (RSS) in a scenario involving one source (or emitter), one Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), and a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To determine the source location based on RSS measurements, we carefully select IRS phases to simplify the relationship between them. Subsequently, we solve the resulting rather simple nonlinear equations using a Least Squares (LS) approach. The solution involves an initial estimation through a course search, followed by a Steepest-Descent (SD) recursion. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of SD compared to course search and some state-of-the-art RSS localization techniques in the literature."
efficient automatic composite-modulation classifier using cyclic-paw-print features,"A novel efficient automatic composite-modulation (CM) classification approach based on the cyclic-paw-print (CPP) features is introduced for future cognitive space communications. In the proposed new scheme, the new image representation of CM signals, a.k.a. CPP named after its biomimetic shape, is constructed from the normalized second-order cyclic-spectrum of the received CM signal. Then, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is further applied to the obtained CPP matrix to extract the essential CM feature vector, which is further digested by use of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Finally, the random forest (RF) is employed to identify the CM scheme of the received signal by taking the aforementioned CM feature vector as the corresponding attributes. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the proposed new scheme can greatly outperform the existing CM classifiers while the proposed scheme requires a low computational-complexity."
deep learning based end-to-end optical wireless communication systems with autoencoders,"The utilization of neural network-based autoencoders (AEs) for the implementation of the physical layer in communication systems has recently emerged as a promising technique for achieving end-to-end optimization of communication links. However, applying conventional AE architecture to intensity modulation/direct detection optical wireless systems is challenging due to positive real-value constraint, eye safety standards, and the limited dynamic range of light sources. To address these issues, in this letter we propose a practical architecture, namely differential AE, that incorporates the concept of differential signaling. This approach allows the transmission of negative encoder output elements. In a shot-noise limited scenario, we assess and compare the performance of the differential AE with state-of-the-art works in the optical wireless domain, highlighting the superior bit-error ratio achieved by the differential AE."
otfs detection based on gaussian mixture distribution: a generalized message passing approach,"The Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has been identified as a promising modulation scheme for wireless communications with high mobility. As for data detection of OTFS symbols, most existing detectors rely on the sophisticated message passing (MP) algorithm and its variants. In particular, the classic sum-product (SP)-MP algorithm can achieve a good detection performance with high complexity, while the Gaussian approximation-based (GA)-MP detector reduces the complexity significantly at the cost of performance degradation. In order to achieve a more flexible detection framework, we propose to adopt the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMD) for representing messages on the factor graph. The proposed scheme can behave as either the classic SP-MP algorithm or the GA-MP algorithm by varying the number of adopted Gaussian components. The simulation results show the proposed scheme can strike a good tradeoff between the error performance and complexity."
a reliable spectrum sensing method based on deep learning for primary user emulation attack detection in cognitive radio network,"Cognitive radio network (CRN) is highly vulnerable to malicious attacks, which can significantly impact the effectiveness and reliability of spectrum sensing. Existing deep learning-based works have proven ineffective in accurately recognizing an unknown attacker due to the prior information about the attacker for training purposes is not easily available in advance. To address the challenge of reliably identifying the known primary user (PU) and the unknown attacker, we combine deep learning with extreme value theory (EVT) to propose a reliable spectrum sensing method for primary user emulation attack (PUEA) detection. Importantly, our method does not rely on acquiring the prior information about the attacker during the training phase. The proposed deep learning-based method not only enables the secondary user (SU) to accurately confirm the presence of PU but also effectively identifies unknown attackers. In addition, the network structure of proposed method is redesigned to extract diverse multi-domain features. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method exhibits remarkable performance under the presence of unknown attacker."
analytical framework for data reception latency modeling in ble 5.x based clustered architecture,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks often require minimal data reception latency, which primarily depends on advertising interval in BLE-based networks. Thus, selecting an optimal advertising interval is crucial to get minimal data reception latency. The existing solutions are limited to homogeneous networks (networks using the same set of BLE parameters). However, an IIoT scenario may have numerous devices incorporated with various sensors of different kinds, generating data of different sizes at different periods, which are likely to form a heterogeneous network, thus raising the need to evaluate the heterogeneous networks. To address these issues, we first analytically derived the optimal advertising interval expression that gives minimal latency for a heterogeneous network consisting of n clusters. Based on the analytical expressions, the algorithms are proposed that autonomously optimize the latency for heterogeneous networks. Moreover, an average energy consumption model is also proposed, which will help the service provider to select the suitable parameters, and further help in calculating the expected battery life of the device in the network. Further, the analytical results are verified by a commercial simulator whose simulation results show a good correlation with analytical results thus validates the proposed model."
snr estimation for 5g satellite-to-ground communication in ultra-low snr environment based on channel frequency response reconstruction,"Accurate estimation of transmission parameters is indispensable in 5G satellite-to-ground communication systems. However, the tricky problem in multipath fading channels is to accurately estimate the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within the operating frequency band. In this work, a novel SNR estimation method is proposed based on the channel frequency response (CFR) reconstruction. The noise variance is obtained based on the variance of CFR difference before and after the least squares discrete Fourier transform (LS-DFT) algorithm, while the signal power is calculated based on the power difference of CFR and the noise variance. In addition, a numerical simulation is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in real satellite-to-ground communication scenarios. The analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm achieves the normalized mean square errors (MSE) of −13.32 dB observed under the ultra-low SNR condition of −15 dB for the non-terrestrial network (NTN) tapped delay line (TDL-B) channels. These results indicate a significant enhancement of 4 dB compared to the maximum likelihood (ML), Boumard’s and Zhang’s methods."
enhancing reasoning ability in semantic communication through generative ai-assisted knowledge construction,"Semantic communication (SemCom), a pioneering paradigm that places emphasis on conveying the meaning of information, faces challenges in constructing background knowledge to drive precise reasoning of semantic coding models. Fortunately, the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology is promising to create high-quality content that can be harnessed to assist knowledge construction in SemCom, enhancing the reasoning ability of semantic coding models. In this letter, we propose a GAI-assisted SemCom framework, named Gen-SC, where sufficient samples for training SemCom transceivers are generated using GAI as per user contextual information. In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples. The simulation results demonstrate that the Gen-SC achieves higher semantic accuracy, especially when the original training samples are insufficient, in contrast to traditional SemCom without knowledge enhancement."
a scheduler for real-time service in wi-fi 8 multi-ap networks with parameterized spatial reuse,"Real-time applications (RTAs) require low delays and impose a significant challenge to Wi-Fi. In Wi-Fi, high delays are often caused by waiting for the channel to become idle. This problem can be solved with Parameterized Spatial Reuse (PSR), which allows a station (STA) to transmit its frame with reduced power simultaneously with a triggered uplink transmission in an overlapping network. The PSR opportunity depends on the pathloss between involved STAs, so the same transmission may allow PSR for one STA but not for another one. Thus, to satisfy tight delay constraints in dense overlapping networks, access points (APs) in the same area shall often allow PSR for every STA with RTA traffic. This letter proposes a fast scheduler enabling frequent PSR transmissions for RTA traffic. The scheduler uses Multi-AP coordination, the feature of upcoming Wi-Fi 8. With simulations, we show that it almost halves the delay for RTA traffic and does not deteriorate the quality of service for other traffic compared with an airtime fairness scheduler."
schwarz information criterion based thompson sampling for dynamic spectrum access in non-stationary environment,"The listen before talk (LBT) mechanism is often used in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) schemes, which requires secondary users (SUs) to perform spectrum sensing before accessing a channel so as to avoid transmission collisions with primary users (PUs). In the scenario of DSA with multiple PU channels, channel sensing order according to the idle probabilities of PU channels is important for SUs to improve the spectrum efficiency. However, conventional DSA schemes are sluggish in updating the estimates of idle probabilities sequentially, which hinders their application in highly dynamic channels (with time-varying idle probabilities). To overcome this issue, we propose a change detection algorithm with a binary hypothesis testing of Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), and present an SIC based Thompson Sampling Algorithm (SIC-TSA) to promptly update the estimates of idle probabilities. Moreover, the collision probabilities among SUs are analyzed. Numerical results are provided to show that SIC-TSA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when channel traffic is high."
adaptation metrics for low-order nonstationary line-of-sight-mimo links,"We derive metrics for adaptation of antenna-element spacing in nonstationary pure line-of-sight MIMO (LOS-MIMO) links. An example of such a deployment is a high-frequency and very high-speed wireless link between an indoor base-station and an untethered mixed-reality headset worn by a user whose distance from the base-station is time-variant. Due to the narrow antenna beams required to close the link budget and highly directional propagation at high frequencies, achieving high transmission spectral efficiency must rely on LOS-MIMO transmission—realization of which depends critically on the distance between transmitter and receiver, as well as on the antenna element spacing at the transmitter and receiver. Therefore, metrics that facilitate quick adaptation of the antenna element spacings in response to changes in the LOS-MIMO link length are required. We derive these metrics for MIMO orders two, three and four (i.e., number of transceiver antennas) and show how the transmission rate of the LOS-MIMO link depends on them. We also show how they can be quickly computed from simple measurements of path phase."
low-cost oam spatial oversampling receiver with 1-bit quantized comparators and dl-based detector,"For existing uniform circular array (UCA)-based orbital angular momentum (OAM) point-to-point communications, the OAM signal can only be detected when the number of antennas of the transmitter and receiver are equal. To break through this barrier, in this letter, we first validate the feasibility of spatial oversampling for OAM reception, which can bring the additional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain at the receiver, thus positively influencing the system’s bit error rate (BER). However, more antennas imply the use of high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in additional radio frequency (RF) chains, which would result in significant power consumption and costs. Equipping low-cost 1-bit ADCs in the RF chain is a viable approach, but it leads to the deterioration of the OAM receiver’s BER. Therefore, we apply comparators and a deep learning (DL)-based detector to the 1-bit quantized OAM receiver to improve the BER. Numerical simulations validate that our proposed OAM receiver can obtain a better BER and reduce the receiver hardware costs."
joint channel estimation and signal detection for lora systems using convolutional neural network,"In long-range (LoRa) systems, the performance of signal detection is significantly affected by channel fading and the same or different spreading factor (co-SF/inter-SF) interference. Although coherent detection in LoRa systems can achieve more robust performance than the non-coherent detection, the channel estimation is required. Due to the co-SF/inter-SF interference, the estimated channel state information (CSI) is inaccurate, thus further resulting in performance degradation. To address this problem, a convolutional neural network based joint channel estimation and signal detection (CNN-JCESD) structure for the LoRa systems is proposed. Specifically, we construct a new frame structure to obtain more accurate CSI under the co-SF/inter-SF interference. Then, we utilize layer normalization technique in data pre-processing to obtain better performance. Moreover, we design a new CNN for the LoRa systems to achieve jointly channel estimation and signal detection. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN-JCESD structure has better performance and more robustness compared to the existing detectors over Rayleigh block-fading channel and the co-SF/inter-SF interference."
multi-armed-bandit-based framed slotted aloha for throughput optimization,"In this letter, a Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for maximizing the network throughput of Framed Slotted Aloha (FSA). The throughput analysis shows that even with the simplest collision receiver, the network throughput of the proposed MAB-based FSA can reach 1 as nodes independently learn to transmit in turn. Yet a tradeoff between throughput and fairness should be considered when the frame size is smaller than the network size."
energy-aware random access networks: connection-based versus packet-based,"Characterizing and comparing the optimal energy efficiency in energy-aware machine-to-machine (M2M) random access networks remains a challenge due to the distributed nature of the access behavior of nodes. To address this issue, this letter focuses on the energy efficiency limits of two typical random access schemes, i.e., connection-based Aloha and packet-based Aloha, based on which we conducted a performance comparison. Specifically, by integrating limited energy constraints and network throughput, the lifetime throughput can be derived, and further optimized with a guarantee of targeted lifetime via selecting the transmission probability. Then we present a comparative study on the optimal lifetime throughput of packet-based Aloha and connection-based Aloha to characterize criteria for beneficial connection establishment."
efficient irs-aided rate optimizations for dual functional radar and communications,"This letter presents a novel method to enable beam steering optimization for secure communications and resilience against radio tracking in an intelligent reflecting surfaces-enabled multiple-input multiple-output dual-functional radar and communications system. The approach involves optimizing beam steering by solving two convex sub-problems: i) maximizing secrecy rate and ii) maximizing legitimate receiver rate, solved using Taylor series approximation. Evaluation results demonstrate that optimizing radar and beam steering enhances secure communications while maintaining quality of service. Furthermore, the utilization of IRS effectively prevents passive eavesdropping in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios."
efficient power allocation strategies in hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces,"Hybrid active-passive RIS incorporates a fixed number of active elements that serve the dual purpose of reflecting and amplifying incoming signals, resulting in a substantial enhancement of system performance under reduced requirements on the overall power consumption. To date, most of the existing research on active-passive RIS-aided systems has not focused on optimizing the number of active elements on the reflective surfaces. Furthermore, the classical problem of maximizing the achievable rate of a hybrid RIS-enhanced single-input single-output (SISO) communication by splitting the power assigned to the transmitter and RIS is commonly overlooked. In this letter, we propose an algorithm that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio at the user by optimizing the number of active loads, the complex-valued reflection coefficients at the RIS array, and the transmit power at the access point. Towards a fairness-oriented design, we compare the performance provided by passive RIS, active RIS, and hybrid RIS. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that hybrid RIS would be superior in scenarios where the overall power allocated to the system is significantly small."
mm-net: a multi-modal approach toward automatic modulation classification,"Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) has become an important component in communication systems for both civil and defense applications. The shortcomings of traditional approaches to AMC have led researchers to develop complex machine learning (ML)-based approaches. In this work, inspired by multi-modal approaches for general Computer Vision tasks like Semantic Segmentation, we propose MM-Net, a multimodal approach to AMC that uses domain-specific features in the form of Higher Order Cumulants (HOCs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, we explore the usage of HOCs in existing Deep Learning (DL)-based applications for AMC. Simulation results show that for eight modulation classification, MM-Net achieves high classification accuracy even at low SNRs, demonstrating the robustness of the multimodal approach even under challenging channel conditions, while existing methods are improved by utilizing HOCs, especially at low SNR values."
multiple-mode sparse superposed code with low block error rate for short packet urllc,"Sparse superposed code (SSC) is one of the most promising techniques to support the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Compared with the conventional sparse vector code (SVC), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols are exploited to carry information bits in SSC. By such an approach, the dimension of the codebook in SSC can be significantly reduced, which results in a lower block error rate (BLER) of the multi-path matching pursuit (MMP)-based decoder. In similar spirit, a multiple-mode SSC (MSSC) is proposed to further reduce BLER. On the encoding side, the information bits are divided into three parts. The first two parts are the same as traditional SSC, while the remaining information bits are mapped as the permutation of the constellation alphabets. On the decoding side, an enhanced MMP-based decoder is developed, where the extra constellation alphabet permutation detection is realized. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MSSC outperforms the conventional SSC significantly."
beam defocus in near-field wideband cylindrical antenna array systems: analysis and mitigation,"In this letter, a near-field wideband cylindrical antenna array (CLA) system is studied. By deriving the transmitted beam gain, we characterize the beam defocus effect in the system. Then, based on the geometry of CLA, we decompose beam defocus in the CLA system into a combination of beam defocus in circular arrays and beam squint in linear arrays. To mitigate the CLA beam defocus, two precoding architectures are proposed, namely the fully-connected true time delay (TTD) architecture and two-stage delay-phase-precoding (DPP) architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed architectures can alleviate the hardware overhead and effectively mitigate beam defocus."
heterogeneous network for inter-nanosat communication with novel modulation schemes and power control,"In this letter, the problems of using radio frequency (RF) or laser to enable inter-NanoSat communication is first analyzed, and the feasibility of adopting visible light communication (VLC) to replace RF and laser is investigated. Two optical modulation schemes with high flexibility and adaptability are proposed, namely improved asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) and improved direct current biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM). Then a heterogeneous optical network architecture is proposed for inter-NanoSat communication, in which NanoSats are grouped into pairs. The two NanoSats in each group utilize improved ACO-OFDM and improved DCO-OFDM respectively to balance optical energy efficiency and spectral efficiency and avoid inter-NanoSat interference. In addition, an optimization problem considering optical power control is formulated to minimize the total bit error rate (BER) of each group. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is more suitable for practical scenarios and can obtain a gain of 3.7 dB at a BER of $10^{ -4}$ ."
enhancing wifi access point localization with ai-based filtering,"Accurate location determination of WiFi access points (APs) is crucial for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Although WiFi beacons are the most common signals emitted by APs, using them for AP position estimation is challenging due to limited bandwidth. This limitation leads to unreliable parameter extraction and hampers AP positioning accuracy. We propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based filter designed to eliminate erroneously extracted parameters. This innovative filter can adapt its criteria based on previously known AP position information, facilitating intelligent collaboration with existing AP localization methods. It begins with a coarse filtering approach to quickly ascertain a rough AP position, then incrementally refines its criteria to enhance AP positioning precision, rigorously preventing the disqualification of data when the AP position is already at a high level of precision. Simulations and experiments consistently confirm that the proposed AI-based filter significantly improves AP positioning accuracy, achieving decimeter-level precision even with only WiFi beacons operating on a 20MHz bandwidth."
reinforcement learning-assisted transmit signal power savings in variable bit-rate fronthaul,"The increasing bit-rate demands placed on the fronthaul from higher user rates and multiple antenna technologies will make the consideration of its power consumption an important issue. In this study, it is assumed that the fronthaul bit-rate can be reduced from the maximum required rate through prediction of the fronthaul traffic using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Using such predictions, and benchmarked simulations of a discrete multitone (DMT) modulation electro-absorption modulator (EAM)-based optical fiber-link, as an example of a fronthaul transmission system, it is shown that the power reduction from reducing the transmitter signal power alongside the reduction in modulation level can be between 22.3% and 34.6% within a fixed bandwidth of 34 GHz and 18 GHz respectively. Such a transmitter could be built as a bandwidth variable transponder in a Flexible Ethernet fronthaul."
uav-enabled integrated sensing and communication: tracking design and optimization,"Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology to facilitate target tracking applications. In contrast to conventional UAV-based ISAC system designs that mainly focus on estimating the target position, the target velocity estimation also needs to be considered due to its crucial impacts on link maintenance and real-time response, which requires new designs on resource allocation and tracking scheme. In this letter, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving object and also communicates with a device attached to the object. Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme. Moreover, three interesting trade-offs on system performance resulted from the fixed elevation angle are illustrated."
optimal m-level two-sided ask for noncoherent simo wireless systems in a rician fading environment,"This letter presents a noncoherent single input multiple output wireless communication system, in which the transmitter utilizes a multi-level two-sided amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation scheme to transmit data symbols over statistically independent Rician fading channels. The receiver applies a maximum likelihood detector to decode the received data. For the performance assessment of such a system, a series-form expression for the union bound on symbol error probability (SEP) is derived and a closed-form expression for the SEP is obtained by applying the central limit theorem when the number of receive antennas is sufficiently large. Moreover, an optimization framework is introduced to obtain optimal ASK constellation, minimizing the SEP under an average transmit energy constraint. The superior performance of the system in comparison with the traditional two-sided ASK constellation is corroborated via numerical results under various parameter configurations."
partitioned analog fountain codes for short packet communications,"Short analog fountain code (AFC) is a promising channel code for short packet communications, particularly in ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) scenarios. This letter proposes a short partitioned transmission strategy based on AFC (PT-AFC) to further enhance the error rate and latency performance of AFC at short block lengths. The key idea is to partition the information block into multiple short blocks, each being encoded using an AFC, and then concatenate the AFC coded symbols. The partitioning of the message allows for parallel decoding of various partitions at the receiver, which significantly reduces the overall latency. Additionally, this letter provides an analytical framework to minimize the number of short cycles in the bipartite graph of the respective code, where we determine an upper bound on the number of partitions, given the information block length and code rate. Simulation results show that PT-AFC outperforms existing AFC schemes with significantly reduced latency."
joint access points-user association and caching placement strategy for cell-free massive mimo systems based on soft actor-critic algorithm,"The joint optimization of APs-user association (AUA) and caching placement (CP) presents a promising method to mitigate the fronthaul overhead and reduce user-perceived latency in cell-free (CF) massive MIMO systems. However, previous studies have not considered the impact of deploying multiple access points (APs) and the user-centric nature of CF massive MIMO systems on joint schemes, while also lacking flexibility in managing caching and association resources. In this letter, we initially develop a latency model based on the collaborative caching and user-centric characteristic. We then formulate a long-term joint optimization problem for AUA and CP to minimize content delivery latency. A two-timescale soft actor-critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning based algorithm is proposed to solve this NP-hard problem. To enhance the convergence of the SAC algorithm, we devise user clustering and cache partitioning schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme exhibits reduced latency compared to the benchmark schemes, while efficiently utilizing fronthaul and caching resources."
two-stage based partial online optimization channel prediction for massive mimo in high-mobility,"In 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, to decrease the pilot overhead, the pilot symbols are not transmitted in every slot, where the slot is the smallest resource allocation unit consisting of several OFDM symbols. For the channel state information (CSI) of the slots without pilot symbols, the channel prediction methods are needed. Although the existing channel prediction methods with online training or optimization can dynamically capture the changing channel in high mobility, abundant additional pilot symbols are required, which aggravate the pilot overhead. In this letter, without any additional pilot symbols, the partial online optimization channel prediction based on two-stage is proposed. In the first stage, with several historical CSI of the slots with pilot symbols, the CSI of the next slot in which the pilot symbols will be transmitted is predicted in advance. By reusing the existing pilot symbols in every several slots, the model parameters can keep being online optimized. In the second stage, combing the predicted CSI in the first stage and the CSI of few previous slots in which the pilot symbols were transmitted, the CSI of the slots without pilot symbols can be predicted via the interpolation operation. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve high accurate channel prediction in high mobility scenarios without any additional pilot overhead."
capacity optimization for cell-free mimo systems with mean and covariance feedback,"This letter studies transmission optimization for cell-free multi-input multi-ouput (MIMO) systems over spatially-correlated Ricean fading channels, where the transmitter only has the statistical channel state information (CSI), i.e. mean and covariance matrices. The transmission covariance matrix is optimized to maximize the ergodic system capacity subject to per access point (AP) power constraints. We first present the Taylor expansion for a scalar function with Hermitian matrix variables, where the Hessian matrix of such function is derived. With it, a majorization-minimization (MM) based algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem, where a sequence of convex subproblems are created. For each subproblem, a surrogate objective function simpler than the original one is constructed so that at each iteration the closed-form solution can be derived. The proposed algorithm is able to converge to the global optimum, whose performance is also illustrated by simulation results."
enhanced uwb ranging utilizing denoising neural network,"This letter introduces a denoising-based two-way ranging (D-TWR) utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for an ultra-wideband (UWB) indoor positioning system. The proposed D-TWR reduces the distance measurement error with a denoising neural network pre-trained on UWB channels in various indoor environments. The denoising model adopts an extended input layer comprising the TWR-measured distance and channel impulse response observations and infers the ground truth distance for UWB ranging. The experimental results provide insights into the performance of the proposed denoising AI model in various indoor environments. Furthermore, it was confirmed that our method can reduce the prediction error of the ranging distance by approximately 34.44% compared to the existing AI regression method, resulting in improved UWB positioning accuracy."
effects of micro-scale mobility and beam misalignment in on-body mmwave systems,"Wearable devices positioned on a human body have challenges in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication due to micro-scale mobility, such as subtle shakes and rotations. These movements can compromise the radio link performance. It may be problematic for high-rate immersive applications, where this can lead to substantial degradation in the user’s quality of experience. In this letter, we propose a framework to quantify the impact of micro-scale mobility and beam misalignment on the performance of on-body mmWave links. Our findings reveal that for varying levels of beam misalignment, it is possible to adjust the antenna half-power beamwidth to enhance the data rates."

The goal is to decrease the number of sensors with outdated information and minimize the difference between their age of information (AoI) and the specified limit, within a resource-constrained environment. The proposed approach relies on reformulating the original problem as a knapsack problem. This novel method is shown to outperform benchmarks to satisfy the needs of priority-aware IoT networks."
automatic modulation classification for ofdm systems using bi-stream and attention-based cnn-lstm model,"Existing deep learning (DL) models for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals consider only spatial or temporal attributes, ignoring feature interaction, which limits their ability to classify higher-order modulation formats. To address this, we propose a bi-stream and attention-based convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) for AMC. It can efficiently extract special and temporal features from the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples and the amplitude and phase (AP) of the received signal for AMC. Each stream consists of a CNN, LSTM, and attention module to extract features from signal patterns, which improves the classification performance. The proposed AMC can classify M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) and higher-order M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) formats in the presence of randomized carrier frequency offset, symbol timing offset, phase offset, and unknown channel state information. The proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of classification accuracy and complexity. Finally, the proposed model has been validated on the real-time dataset generated by the radio frequency testbed."

By extending the block-error threshold condition proposed by A. K. Pradhan et al. for conventional GLDPC codes, we optimize medium to high-rate PD-GLDPC codes with degree-1 variable nodes and multi-types of component codes (MCC). It is shown that the optimized PD-GLDPC codes outperform the conventional LDPC and GLDPC codes at the frame error rate 10−4 over the BEC while having comparable decoding complexity."
robust adaptive beamforming method based on steering vector phase correction and covariance matrix reconstruction,"Steering vector (SV) mismatch caused by the DOA uncertainty in the source leads to a remarkable performance degradation for adaptive beamforming particularly in situation where the training data includes an unknown expected signal (ES) component. To mitigate this problem, a robust adaptive beamforming method based on SV phase correction and covariance matrix reconstruction is proposed in this letter. The first step is to correct the SV phase of the ES using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method. Next, the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature is introduced to efficiently reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix by integrating within the corrected azimuthal sector. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in mitigating SV mismatch errors are confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental results."
isi-resistant reference signal design and processing for ofdm integrated communications and long-range radar sensing,"The cyclic prefix orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (CP-OFDM) waveform is considered an important candidate for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in B5G/6G networks. However, due to the limited CP duration, especially for mmWave communications, the radar sensing can only achieve a short sensing range without inter-symbol-interference (ISI). To resolve this problem, a novel reference signal (RS) design and corresponding signal processing scheme are developed for OFDM long-range radar sensing. More specifically, the zero-power RS (ZP-RS) and non-zero-power RS (NZP-RS) are alternately deployed at subcarriers. The time samples in the second-half symbol-duration are first extracted, and then a simple fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) or that with additional pre-phase-rotation is conducted for subsequent radar sensing processing to achieve a long ISI-free sensing range. The performance gain over conventional design is first derived by mathematical analysis and further validated by simulation results."
a vt-code-based information reconciliation scheme for secret key generation using rss,"Received signal strength (RSS) has been widely used as the channel parameter in physical-layer key generation (PKG). However, the RSS sequences obtained by legitimate users may be misaligned due to sampling deviation and packet loss, resulting in key generation failure. Conventional information reconciliation schemes are not applicable to this misalignment problem. This letter models the misalignment problem as an insertion/deletion problem for the first time and proposes an information reconciliation scheme based on the Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) code. There are two application modes in our scheme, which are discussed from three aspects. Furthermore, we analytically quantify the information leakage of the scheme. Experimental results show the effectiveness and security of the scheme. When the SNR is 15 dB, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the key disagreement ratio from initially 0.09 to 0.01."

Based on the obtained ISI-suppressed channel, a low-complexity delay-based precoding algorithm is developed to minimize the transmit power of the base station (BS) by exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) framework, where the transmit and reflect precoding vectors are updated simultaneously at each iteration. The numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme."

We concentrate on reducing the transmitting power through the optimization of active and passive beamforming and power allocation, while ensuring that BackCom performance remains uncompromised. Unlike previous studies on RIS neglecting the relationship between amplitude and phase shift of the signal reflected by RIS, our work takes into account the practical phase shift and amplitude response. In order to get solutions for the optimisation problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization (AO) and minimization-maximization approaches. We also suggest a nonlinear function fitting technique and a trust region inspection algorithm to reduce the computational complexity."

By utilizing the ability of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to modulate wireless signals rapidly, this letter proposes a multi-RIS-assisted static environmental sensing method to address these issues in limited hardware resource scenarios. Precisely, we model the environment as a point cloud, which is sensed by detecting the direction of the reflected signal at each point. Then, an atomic norm minimization (ANM)-based environment sensing algorithm is proposed to sense the distribution of points. Simulation results show that this method can achieve environmental sensing with an error margin of no more than 0.05 meters in a single-user, single-antenna scenario."
boosting open-set rf signal recognition under low snr condition in feature space,"Open-set recognition of radio frequency signals (OSR-RF) encounters challenges from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in practical scenarios. In the feature space, we ascertain that in-distribution (ID) features demonstrate a greater distance to the feature space singularity (FSSd) while out-of-distribution (OOD) features cluster around the FSS. However, we find that as the SNR decreases, ID features gradually become less compact and approach the FSS, posing a challenge in discriminating between ID and OOD features. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel learning framework, termed FSS Learning (FSSL), which encourages the formation of compact and closed classification boundaries for ID features and simultaneously pushes ID features away from FSS, thereby reducing the overlap between known and unknown spaces. Then we propose an effective OSR scoring function, named FSSd-scaled nearest ID Center distance (FSS-IDC), which further enhances the discriminability between ID and OOD features. Experimental comparisons indicate that the proposed method achieves superior OSR-RF performance under low SNR conditions."
flca: a flexible coding approach through 5g nr ldpc codes,"This letter proposes a flexible coding approach (FLCA) for quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes based on the base graphs and lifting factors in 5G new radio (NR). The FLCA can achieve almost all code rates and blocklengths supported by 5G physical layer using a novel shortening method which is different from those used in 5G NR. In the proposed FLCA, the shortening patterns are optimized according to the code rates and modulation schemes, including quadrature phase shift keying, 16-ary and 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulations. Our proposed method is fully applicable to the existing LDPC codes of 5G and makes the encoding more flexible. Both the numerical thresholds of PEXIT analysis and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coding approach can bring noticeable performance gain over the current LDPC codes used in 5G NR."

While previous studies focused on the achievable minimum distortion with an infinite number of channel symbols, we also consider the robustness to finite symbols. The constructed scheme is based on the hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding method, which encodes the quantized value of the source and the quantization error using a large number of channel symbols in total. Theoretical analysis reveals that our scheme achieves the optimal exponent and the same polynomial decay as in the existing work. Experimental results validate the performance gains of our scheme over the cutting-edge ones."
error performance analysis of uav-mounted ris for noma systems with practical constraints,"Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted recent attention for sixth-generation (6G) networks due to their low cost and flexible deployment. In order to maximize the ever-increasing data rates, spectral efficiency, and wider coverage, technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are adapted with UAVs (UAV-RIS NOMA). However, the error performance of UAV-RIS NOMA has not been considered, yet. In this letter, we investigate the error probability of UAV-RIS NOMA systems. We also consider the practical constraints of hardware impairments (HWI) at the transceivers, inter-cell interference (ICI), and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The analytical derivations are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results demonstrate that our proposed system achieves higher performance gain (more than 5 dB with increasing the number of RIS elements) with less error probability compared to UAVs without RIS. Moreover, it is found that the HWI, ICI, and imperfect SIC have shown a negative impact on the system performance."
convergence analysis and optimization of swipt-based over-the-air federated learning,"Federated learning (FL) are challenging for low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited energy storage. In this letter, to solve this difficulty, Base Station (BS) uses simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to spread the global model and charge every device during each FL round. The convergence gap of SWIPT-based FL is derived to capture the effect of wireless communications on the learning performance. To speed FL convergence, a non-convex problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transceiver beamforming and power-splitting ratio. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms benchmarks in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence."

New expressions for the AMR are derived for non-cooperative and cooperative multicasting scenarios. Asymptotic analyses are conducted in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime to derive the array gain and diversity order. It is proved that the analog beamformer influences the AMR through its array gain, leading to the proposal of efficient beamforming algorithms aimed at maximizing the array gain to enhance the AMR."

Shortening and puncturing have been adopted to achieve flexible code rates and code lengths for different application scenarios in 5G Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, which leads to a challenge for their blind recognition. In this letter, a novel Extended Exponent Matrix (EEM) reconstruction method is proposed to find complete parity checks for punctured codes, which offers the feasibility of Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) based blind recognition of punctured linear block codes over a candidate set. Simultaneously, a lifting size parallel operation via the quasi-cyclic property of 5G LDPC codes and limited weights of parity checks are employed in our proposed algorithm to efficiently reduce the reconstruction complexity. At last, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our reconstruction algorithm."
list-based residual belief-propagation decoding of ldpc codes,"This letter presents an enhanced list-based residual belief propagation (L-RBP) method for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. L-RBP reduces computational complexity by scheduling a concise list of residuals. Moreover, the list is partially renewed to deter a small cluster of residuals from monopolizing renewal opportunities. Simultaneously, we also incorporate a decay mechanism to constrain the residuals retained within the list, further mitigating the greediness of the algorithm. The numerical results indicate that the L-RBP has an attractive convergence speed, error rate performance, and complexity of long-length and low-rate codes in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel."
reliability-aware clock offset tracking with timestamp validation in ieee 1588 networks,"Precision clock synchronization is a prerequisite for distributed networks. IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) specifies a synchronization mechanism for estimating and adjusting clock parameters. However, accurate clock offset estimation for PTP is based on the assumption of symmetric path delays and accurate timestamping, which may not hold in reality. To resolve this issue, a reliable clock offset tracking scheme based on residual-aware augmented Kalman filter (RA2KF) is proposed, which is robust against unexpected path delay asymmetries and can smooth the effects of inaccurate time measurements. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of this tracking scheme."
an intelligent energy-efficient handover scheme based on comp for heterogeneous network,"With the exponential growth of user equipment (UE) access in future networks, service operators are deploying many low-cost and low-power heterogeneous base stations. However, when considering cooperative multi-point (CoMP) based soft handover schemes, there will be a trade-off between user quality of service (QoS), system power consumption, and handover frequency. Therefore, in this letter, we proposed a CoMP-based energy-efficient intelligent handover algorithm, named CEH-PPO in heterogeneous cellular networks. The proposed scheme is based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in deep reinforcement learning. The optimization objective is to maximize the average user rates and minimize energy consumption and handover frequency in the CoMP-based heterogeneous network. Thus, we can dynamically select the transmission base station set for UEs to accomplish the handover procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CEH-PPO algorithm simultaneously improves the average QoS of UEs in the system and reduces the overall handover frequency while reducing the overall power consumption."
a fast neural network solution for optimal scsi aided two-user miso broadcast beamforming,"This letter re-investigates the difficult statistical sum-rate maximization for two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast beamforming (BF). The identified linear structure of the Pareto-optimal (PO) BF vectors interprets the optimal statistical channel state information (SCSI) aided two-user MISO broadcast BF vectors as the linear combinations of the statistical maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and the statistical zero-forcing (ZF) BF. Inspired by this knowledge, a SCSI enabled BF neural network “MRT-ZF-BNN” is constructed for fast determining optimal two-user MISO statistical BF. The simulation results confirm the improved sum-rate and computational efficiency of the devised MRT-ZF-BNN over the existing baselines."

However, hardware impairments (HWIs) and imperfect channel state information (CSI) pose challenges to OAC. While previous studies assume ideal hardware and perfect CSI, this letter investigates the joint impact of HWIs and imperfect CSI on the mean square error (MSE) of OAC. This work presents a mathematical framework for average MSE, revealing the negative impact of HWIs and channel estimation error. The results demonstrate the necessity for designs that can improve system performance."
vt-mcnet: high-accuracy automatic modulation classification model based on vision transformer,"Cognitive radio networks’ evolution hinges significantly on the use of automatic modulation classification (AMC). However, existing research reveals limitations in attaining high AMC accuracy due to ineffective feature extraction from signals. To counter this, we propose a vision-centric approach employing diverse kernel sizes to augment signal extraction. In addition, we refine the transformer architecture by incorporating a dual-branch multi-layer perceptron network, enabling diverse pattern learning and enhancing the model’s running speed. Specifically, our architecture allows the system to focus on relevant portions of the input sequence, thus, it improves classification accuracy for both high and low signal-to-noise regimes. By utilizing the widely recognized DeepSig dataset, our pioneering deep model, termed as VT-MCNet, outshines prior leading-edge deep networks in terms of classification accuracy and computational costs. Notably, VT-MCNet reaches an exceptional cumulative classification rate of up to 99.24%, while the state-of-the-art method, even with higher computational complexity, can only achieve 99.06%."

Unlike the existing works that mainly focus on the UAV position and decoding errors, this letter aims to maximize the end-to-end information rate by optimizing the blocklengths and UAV trajectory, subject to the requirements of UAV flight limitations and finite blocklengths. Although the formulated problem is an intractable non-convex problem with mixed integer programming, by analyzing the structure of the problem, we develop an effective solution algorithm combining successive convex approximation (SCA), relaxation, and integerization techniques. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
multipath parameters estimation of near-field spatial-wideband systems,"This letter proposes a low-complexity, one-snapshot angle, range and channel gain estimation algorithm for a sparse multipath near-field spatial-wideband system. With upcoming mm-wave & sub-THz systems expected to operate massive antenna arrays, the transmitted wideband signal is not only sensitive to the propagation delay across the array aperture but the resulting wavefront is no longer planar. A modified wideband discrete linear chirp transform (DLCT) is used to estimate the multipath parameters of such a system. Furthermore, an iterative neighbourhood search is proposed to acquire super-resolution estimates of the scatterer locations, path gain and the multipath’s arrival angle. We also show that they are asymptotically optimal approaching their respective Cramér-Rao bounds."
a fuzzy learning anti-jamming approach with incomplete information,"This letter investigates the power control anti-jamming problem with dynamic incomplete channel state information (CSI). To cope with the challenge of existing methods in obtaining steady-state solutions with dynamic incomplete CSI, the incomplete information is mapped to a fuzzy space, and then the payoffs of the user and the malicious jammer are expressed by fuzzy numbers. Further, to formulate the continuous adjustment process of the strategies of adversarial parties, an anti-jamming fuzzy Stackelberg game model is proposed and it is proven that fuzzy Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE) exists regardless of whether the user or the jammer is the leader. Finally, a fuzzy learning algorithm based on Q-learning is introduced to obtain the proposed FSE, which evaluates the fuzzy payoffs by selecting a suitable viewpoint and utilizing a satisfaction function. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively addresses the impact of CSI dynamic uncertainty, gets rid of the reliance of existing methods on deterministic information, and still guides game participants to optimize strategies in dynamic uncertainty environments. Compared with traditional learning algorithms, the results of the proposed method are satisfactory."

In particular, we focus on maximizing the CRN’s throughput using the joint allocation of cooperation slot, power-splitting factor, and beamforming design at the cognitive base station (CBS) and RIS subject to the CBS’s power budget, primary user (PU) cooperation rate, and quality of service for the secondary users (SUs). To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated time-variant resource allocation problem, we adopt an algorithm based on modified proximal policy optimization (MPPO) that dynamically adjusts the penalty coefficient to ensure better control of the optimization process. Simulation results demonstrate that the MPPO algorithm outperforms conventional deep learning algorithms regarding CRN’s sum-throughput maximization. Moreover, the proposed RIS-aided RSMA framework offers a relatively high data rate compared to traditional schemes."
a dual-function ofdm waveform design for future multicarrier communication,"This letter proposes a novel orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform termed MDS-OFDM-IM, in which the subcarriers are divided into two distinct groups with specific functions: peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction and error detection. The PAPR reduction subcarriers employ a selective mapping (SLM) scheme without side information, while the error detection subcarriers are modulated by a simple maximum distance separable (MDS) coded modulation scheme. In our design, the index modulation (IM) concept is exploited to the locations of PAPR reduction subcarriers for carrying extra information. Moreover, a novel power allocation strategy between the aforementioned two groups is proposed to balance system error and PAPR performances, which is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by a search-based method. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of MDS-OFDM-IM over conventional OFDM and OFDM-IM in both error and PAPR performances."

Most existing methods optimize the system via block coordinate descent (BCD) methods with relaxation of the objective function, which leads to performance gaps. To directly solve the channel capacity maximization problem in a double-IRS aided system, we propose a unified manifold optimization (UMO) framework to rephrase the problem as an unconstrained Riemannian problem. Specifically, a unified manifold space (UMS) is constructed to satisfy the constraints of the IRS and the precoding matrix, and a parallel conjugate gradient algorithm is derived to solve the problem over the UMS.

alternative zero codebooks for mocz with reduced papr,"Modulation over conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) is a noncoherent modulation scheme proposed for short-packet communication. In this letter, we first derive a closed-form expression for the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of binary Huffman MOCZ. We propose new rotated and skew Huffman zero codebooks by modifying the plain Huffman one. Then we combine the plain, rotated, and skew Huffman zero codebooks to obtain a mixed Huffman MOCZ scheme that yields large savings in PAPR. For an 8-bit mixed Huffman MOCZ with outer radius <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$R=1.1791$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, a 38% reduction in PAPR is achieved by choosing an angle parameter <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$\theta =60^{\circ } $ </tex-math></inline-formula> for the 4 bit skew Huffman component."

In this letter, we propose an early-stopping strategy based on a novel relative partial path metric (RPPM) for SC/SCL flip algorithms to reduce the decoding latency and complexity in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. By introducing a dynamic threshold, the proposed strategy can delete as many redundant decoding operations as possible while keeping the performance deterioration in a tolerant region. Simulation results show that compared to the original SC/SCL flip algorithms, the proposed early-stopping strategy can achieve significant reductions in average complexity across various code lengths and rates, especially in low SNR regions."
joint pulse index and spatial modulation,"According to the planned key performance indicator (KPI) standards, 6G technology should achieve higher throughput than 5G. More efficiency in transceiver schemes is required to meet this demand. In this study, we take advantage of spatial modulation (SM) and pulse index modulation (PIM) techniques to increase spectral efficiency. The proposed PIM-SM scheme utilizes well-localized and orthogonal Hermite-Gaussian pulses along with spatial indexing. Thanks to the orthogonality between pulses in the set, multiple pulses are transmitted together. The design, simulation, and analytical bit error rate performance derivations of PIM-SM are discussed in this letter to verify the viability and compatibility of pulse-based data transfer utilizing the spatial domain. The performance is compared with generalized code index modulation-spatial modulation (GCIM-SM), code index modulation-quadrature spatial modulation (CIM-QSM), and classical spatial modulation (SM) schemes."
cau-net: a convolutional attention u-network for radar signal deinterleaving,"The deinterleaving of radar signals is designed to segregate distinct pulses within a composite signal, facilitating the detailed analysis of individual components. This process is pivotal in situational awareness applications, including target signal interception and cognitive jamming antagonism. In the existing electromagnetic environment, the radar emitter pulse modulation parameters will be jitter modulated to improve its anti-identification ability, leading to the lack of integrity of the pulse features obtained from the measurements and the degradation of the deinterleaving performance of the existing methods. In this letter, a Convolutional Attention U-Network (CAU-Net) is proposed to deinterleave the original signal. Guided by the attentional mechanism, the feature of the original signal is extracted by the Attention Down-Sampling (ADS) block without necessitating pulse measurement. Then, it is used to classify the predicted pulses by the Feature Fusion Up-Sampling (FFUS) block, with the prior maximum number of radar emitters in each sample. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed CAU-Net in terms of deinterleaving and complexity, and its robustness is confirmed under various noise conditions."

To accomplish this, semantic communication with the help of machine learning and natural language processing technologies can play a crucial role. However, existing semantic communication systems fail to model the interaction between semantics and emotion, which is vital for personalized communication. This letter proposes an emotion-aided semantic communication system that utilizes an external knowledge base for emotion extraction at the transmitter and adopts emotion recognition and selection at the receiver for semantic recovery. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating emotional knowledge into semantic communication, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region."

In CE-FuFormer, a cross-scale embedding layer is introduced to convert the input signal into an embedding with multiple scale features. To reduce the computational complexity of the model, we allocate fewer channel dimensions for large convolution kernels. A fusion transformer encoder (FTE) module is proposed for simultaneous local and global information extraction of the input modulated signal features. In addition, we rationally allocate the channel dimensions of the CNN part in the FTE module to reduce the generation of parameters while maintaining network performance. The proposed CE-FuFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the datasets RadioML2016.10a and RadioML2018.01a."
machine learning-based noma for multiuser miso broadcast channels,"This letter proposes machine learning-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC), where a transmitter selects and serves multiple users with a fixed rate using NOMA. Unlike a single-input single-output NOMA, where the optimal decoding order is determined by channel gains, the optimal decoding order for a MISO NOMA should be found with a brute force approach. In this case, the transmitter needs to check the validity of all decoding orders under a transmit power budget, so should calculate power allocations for all decoding order candidates, whose complexity is prohibitive as the number of users increases. Our proposed scheme uses a machine learning model to directly predict the optimal decoding order based on channel gains and cross-channel correlations. Once the decoding order is determined, we only need to calculate the power allocation for that decoding order, greatly reducing complexity. Our results show that our machine learning model performs well in finding the optimal decoding order and achieves performance comparable to the optimal scheme."
drl-driven optimization for energy efficiency and fairness in noma-uav networks,"The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in internet of things (IoT) communications has gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to adapt to different positions and access areas with limited infrastructure. To support a large number of IoT devices, UAV networks have extensively integrated non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. In this study, we propose an innovative Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to improve the Energy Efficiency (EE) while considering far-near fairness (FNF) in NOMA-UAV networks. This agent is designed to simultaneously control dynamic factors such as UAV 3D trajectory, downlink transmit power, IoT nodes association, and power allocation (PA). We compare our solution with the Hybrid Decision Framework (HDF) approach through comprehensive simulations. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over HDF in terms of effectiveness."

We assume that users only know the knowledge of statistical channel state information (CSI), and account for correlated Rayleigh fading to meet realistic conditions. The use-and-then-forget (UatF) bound of the sum-rate has been derived by assuming maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding. Notably, a projected gradient ascent method (PGAM) algorithm has been used to optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS panel simultaneously. Our simulations show that the sum-rate can be improved as the noise concentration parameter of the Von Mises (VM) distribution increases."
downlink carrier frequency offset estimation for otfs-based leo satellite communication system,"Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) is a pivotal component of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication. The dependability of satellite-to-ground communication is severely hampered by large-scale Doppler frequency offsets. We propose a carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator applied to orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. By inserting the pilot and maximum length sequences (MLS) for each OTFS frame in the delay-Doppler domain, the estimator can search for the corresponding equal-amplitude sequences and MLS along different dimensions in the delay-time domain. The fractional CFO, obtained by weighting the signal phase determined by the received sample’s correlation function, is the best linear unbiased estimate. The proposed estimator well enhances the estimation range by employing a correlation technique with MLS to estimate the large-scale CFO. Finally, we conduct numerous simulations on the time-varying channel. The results demonstrate a minimum of 53% reduction in frequency estimation error and a minimum 32-fold increase in estimation range compared with existing algorithms."
a design of transfer learning receiver for mimo-ofdm systems,"In recent years, deep learning (DL) has seen extensive applications in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. In particular, DL has been integrated into receivers to enhance signal processing capabilities, exemplified by the DeepReceiver. However, such integrations typically train on static scenarios, resulting in suboptimal performance in dynamic real-world conditions and limiting broader applicability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a DL-based receiver that employs transfer learning (TL) in MIMO-OFDM systems for rapid and accurate signal detection after sufficient training. Especially, we develop a novel binary classifier to accelerate training processes. Furthermore, we propose two TL strategies tailored for the DeepReceiver, designed to facilitate quick retraining under changing conditions. Simulation results confirm that our proposed receiver not only achieves superior bit error rate performance but also adapts more effectively to dynamic channels."
tdoa based direct positioning of co-channel signals using cyclic cross-spectral functions,"Passive positioning of co-channel transmitters is a major challenge in radio monitoring. Co-channel signals overlap in both the time and frequency domains but have different cyclic frequencies. A direct localization method of multiple co-channel signals is proposed in this letter based on the relative time delay information of collected signals and cyclic cross-spectral functions. It can estimate the number and cyclic frequencies of co-channel signals and separate co-channel signals through spectral slicing for direct positioning. A joint spectral function is constructed with a set of randomly generated position points, and the position estimate for each co-channel signal can be determined by searching for the maximum value of the function. Additionally, an iterative sampling method is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy with only a few additional iterations.

semantic communications for multi-view generation,"Semantic communication has shown great potential in efficiently accomplishing intelligent tasks. However, existing systems usually make a single-view decision in a deterministic manner while ignoring the intrinsic semantic noise caused by ambiguity. This may result in the misunderstanding during the exchange of semantic information. In this letter, we propose a novel probabilistic uncertainty coding (PUC) architecture to achieve versatile multi-view semantic communications with multiple outputs. Specifically, each feature region is characterized as a Gaussian distribution whose variance represents semantic uncertainty. Then, we leverage the Gaussian information bottleneck theory to jointly optimize the rate-distortion tradeoff between the semantic informativeness and inference performance. Moreover, we provide a semantic similarity metric to evaluate the accuracy of multi-view semantic communication. Considering the cross-modal task of semantic knowledge transfer, simulation results show that PUC outperforms conventional deterministic method and traditional separate transmissions. Due to its semantic-aware capability, the proposed PUC can make diverse yet plausible predictions in a highly reliable and low-latency manner."
design and performance of enhanced spread spectrum aloha for unsourced multiple access,"We analyze the performance of enhanced spread spectrum Aloha (E-SSA) in the framework of unsourced multiple access (UMAC). The asynchronous, unframed transmission of E-SSA is modified to enable a direct comparison with framed UMAC schemes and with Polyanskiy's achievability bound. The design of E-SSA is tailored to the UMAC setting, resorting to short polar codes and the use of a timing channel to improve the energy efficiency of the protocol. We assess the impact of the preamble length and of the spreading factor on the system efficiency. The resulting scheme exhibits simplicity at the transmitter and linear complexity with respect to the number of active users at the receiver, approaching the UMAC achievability bound in close competition with the best known UMAC schemes."

The approach has been verified through simulation and experiment, with identification precision of 97.02%. After mitigating errors, substantial error reductions of 91.80% and 98.90% were observed in LOS and NLOS situations, respectively. Moreover, the developed IRUKF effectively minimizes mislocalization by 50.48% in harsh scenarios."

In this letter, we focus on improving the performance of the ISAC system by utilizing constructive interference (CI) to optimize the sensing performance, which is characterized by the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of target response matrix (TRM) estimation. To achieve higher estimation accuracy while maintaining communication quality, we propose two methods: a heuristic semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based alternative minimization approach and a successive convex approximation (SCA) method. These methods address the optimization problem by dealing with the non-convexity present in the objective function. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in enhancing the ISAC performance compared to the baseline block-level based precoding designs."

The sparse-connected multi-causal convolution attention transformer (SC-MCCATrasformer) can simultaneously decompose the prior cascaded channel and parallelly predict the next several channels. Furthermore, relying on the improved attention module, more local context features can be extracted to predict more realistic channels. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over other channel prediction methods. Moreover, our proposed methods demonstrated enhanced accuracy in CSI acquisition."
employing single photons for measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication with identity authentication,"Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) enables secure message transmission without needing pre-shared keys. To enhance the practical reliability of QSDC systems, measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocols have emerged, providing robust security in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of MDI protocols, their implementation has not yet accomplished communication using only single photons which are advantageous due to their ease of preparation and transmission. In this letter, by employing single photons, we propose a novel MDI-QSDC protocol with identity authentication. This protocol achieves mutual identity authentication between the communicating parties, Alice and Bob, enabling authenticated Alice to securely transmit her secret message directly to authenticated Bob. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the protocol is resilient to identity and message security threats. Simulations with practical experimental parameters and efficiency analysis highlight its potential in quantum communication."

Uplink RS provides flexible co-channel interference management by splitting user messages. Additionally, active IRS allows us to disrupt the potential eavesdropper through phase adjustment and signal amplification, thereby providing an additional layer of security to the data transmission process. We devise an algorithm for the optimization of key parameters, namely, transmit power allocation, receiver filter, IRS amplification factor matrix, and IRS phase shift matrix. The overarching goal is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate across all users, ensuring equitable security measures. Simulation results demonstrate that our security scheme achieves considerable gains over several existing benchmarks."

In this letter, we propose an OAM mode modulation-based wireless backhaul communication scheme for the downlink in a broadcast network. According to the principle of superposition of electric fields, this scheme generates multiple OAM modes simultaneously through uniform circular array(UCA) for information modulation and radiates signals to the outside in a periodic cyclic excitation manner. This scheme does not require the alignment of transmitting and receiving antennas, and the deployment of the receiving antenna position can be very flexible. Compared with QAM modulation, OAM mode modulation has strong anti-interference performance. Meanwhile, as the modulation order increases, the bit error rate(BER) will not change significantly."

Both of these two codes consist of binary marker codes which are employed to locate the burst of deletions/insertions. Also, the marker-MDS and marker-SVT codes consist of the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes and shifted Varshamov-Tenengol’ts (SVT) codes, respectively, which are responsible for correcting erasures caused in the synchronization stage. Both the theoretical and simulation results verify that the constructed marker-MDS and marker-SVT codes provide the higher code rate than the existing run-length limited Varshamov-Tenengol’ts shifted Varshamov-Tenengol’ts (RLLVT-SVT) codes if <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is not smaller than a lower bound <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$f(t)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> which is determined by <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula>."
aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted channel modeling incorporating the effect of uav fluctuations,"Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) system refers to a novel transmission scheme, in which an RIS is mounted on aerial platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to achieve intelligent signal reflection over the air. Compared to terrestrial RIS, ARIS extends the service area and enables panoramic signal reflections. Benefiting from its high altitude, the UAV is more likely to establish line-of-sight (LoS) connections with ground nodes. However, implementing ARIS systems is challenging. Owing to atmospheric turbulence or propeller rotations, the UAV can experience random fluctuations, which lead to misalignment of reflected signal phases. In this letter, a three-dimensional (3D) ARIS-assisted channel model is proposed, in which UAV fluctuations are described by random processes. Statistics including temporal correlation function (TCF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD), and ergodic achievable rate are obtained. Results show that even for a minor vibration, the UAV wobbling can introduce extra Doppler frequency components, and significantly reduce the temporal correlation and achievable rate of the ARIS-assisted channel when systems operating at high frequency bands."
cooperative target search algorithm for uav swarms with limited communication and energy capacity,"Target search by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has wide applications in rescue, round-up, and border patrol. However, a single UAV cannot satisfy target search in a wide region with limitations of sensing range, search time capacity, etc. Compared with a single UAV, UAV swarms have higher performance in target search, while communication, energy consumption, and cooperation efficiency have limitations. In this article, we propose a UAV swarms cooperative search model (USCSM) with the limitations of communication and energy capacity. The proposed model is modelled as an exact potential game to complete it efficiently, and we introduce a binary log-linear learning jointing dung beetle optimizer algorithm (BLLL-DBO) to optimize the proposed model. The simulation results indicate that the suggested method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of region coverage rate and target search efficiency."
quasi-isolated network slicing for multi-access edge computing,"Network slicing via next-generation multiple access techniques and multi-access edge computing (MEC) are considered key enablers for meeting the heterogeneous quality of service requirements of the sixth-generation (6G) networks. Thus, in this work, we investigate the coexistence of further enhanced mobile broadband (feMBB) and ultra-massive machine-type communications (umMTC) devices in a quasi-isolated (QI) heterogeneous uplink MEC network, where users of both services share the same resources, interfering with each other. The feMBB users can partially offload their data to the MEC server utilizing the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) protocol, while the umMTC users perform only full offloading. We formulate and optimally solve the problem of maximizing the number of umMTC devices subject to data processing time and data rate constraints by adjusting both the decoding order of the users and the power splitting factor of the RSMA, while a closed-form expression for the optimal partial offloading factor of the feMBBs devices is derived. Simulation results verify that utilizing the RSMA protocol, the QI MEC network has the potential to support more umMTC devices compared to the isolated one."

We solve the problem of maximizing the minimum UE’s secrecy rate via beam focusing in the near-field, subject to the transmit power budget constraint and unit-modulus phase shift constraints of the analog beamformer. We propose a computationally efficient way to solve this problem by employing successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance superiority of the proposed near-field beam focusing algorithm over the existing state-of-the-art techniques. We also discuss new interesting insights arising from the coexistence of multiple EVs and multiple UEs in the same angular direction."

To that end, simple and accurate analytic expressions are derived considering the involved battery charging intervals as well as the length of the data segment, available bandwidth and delay constraints. These expressions are corroborated by numerical simulations and they are subsequently used in developing useful theoretical and practical insights of interest. Besides highlighting the importance of the new data-oriented DOR metric, the offered results are shown to be useful in the design of realistic energy harvesting-based data transmission systems in future networks."

The second method harnesses sensor cooperation through a novel mixture detector based on meta-analysis, a statistical method that combines results from multiple independent tests. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed detectors, we conduct a comprehensive case study that considers shadowing effects and frequency-selective multipath channels between PUs and sensors. Our results demonstrate that the two WSS methods exhibit remarkable detection performance, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, outperforming a set of machine learning-based state-of-the-art solutions."
channel estimation for wideband mmwave mimo-ofdm system with beam squint effect,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has been widely considered as a key enabler for the future wireless systems. To combat the high propagation loss associated with mmWave band, accurate channel state information is especially essential for achieving large beamforming gain. However, due to the influence of beam squint effect and frequency-selective fading, accurate channel estimation is challenging in a typical wideband multiple-input multiple-output system. To tackle this issue, by exploiting the structure information of the wideband channel, we first recast the channel estimation as a joint sparse signal recovery problem. Building upon this, we propose a channel estimation scheme that can effectively refine the relevant channel parameters in an iterative minimization manner. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

Then, a perfect matching graph is simply obtained, by selecting the edges more likely to be faulty. A comparative analysis reveals that the STM decoder, at the cost of a slight performance degradation, provides a substantial advantage in decoding time compared to the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder. Finally, we propose an even more simplified and faster algorithm, the Rapid-Fire (RFire) decoder, designed for scenarios where decoding speed is a critical requirement."
localization in multipath environments via active sensing with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces,"This letter investigates an uplink pilot-based wireless indoor localization problem in a multipath environment for a single-input single-output (SISO) narrowband communication system aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The indoor localization problem is challenging because the uplink channel consists of multiple overlapping propagation paths with varying amplitudes and phases, which are not easy to differentiate. This letter proposes the use of RIS capable of adaptively changing its reflection pattern to sense such a multiple-path environment. Toward this end, we train a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based controller to perform adaptive sequential reconfigurations of the RIS over multiple stages and propose to group multiple pilots as input in each stage. Information from the multiple paths is captured by training the LSTM to generate multiple RIS configurations to align to the different paths within each stage. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in significantly reducing training complexity while maintaining localization performance at fixed number of pilots."

The proposed algorithm is intended to alleviate adverse effects of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation and considers air-to-ground channel model, which is mainly divided into two parts: identification and localization. First, UAV is used as an aerial mobile anchor to capture time-of-arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSS) measurements. According to Neyman-Pearson theorem, a joint TOA-RSS hypothesis test is performed to identify NLOS links. After that, if there are enough line-of-sight (LOS) measurements, NLOS links are discarded and only LOS links are used for multilateration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms for identifying NLOS links compared with existing methods, and can ensure high localization accuracy in NLOS propagation environment."

an efficient information reconciliation scheme via partial encoding for physical layer secret key generation,"This letter proposes an efficient information reconciliation coding scheme for physical layer secret key generation. We consider a high-rate key generation system, where multiple key bits are extracted from one Gaussian random variable source, each of which has different reliability depending on its bit level. Although the conventional bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)-type reconciliation protects all the key bits by forward error correction (FEC), the computational complexity associated with its encoding and decoding can be a bottleneck in achieving a high secret key rate especially for low-cost devices with limited computational capabilities. To alleviate this complexity issue, we propose a new reconciliation scheme that efficiently reduces the complexity by applying FEC only to the least reliable bits (LRBs). We demonstrate by simulations that the proposed information reconciliation based on partial encoding achieves a lower key bit mismatch rate (BMR) than the conventional BICM-type reconciliation even with lower decoding complexity. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound on the asymptotic BMR of the proposed scheme that is useful for estimating the performance in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."

can channels be fully inferred between two antenna panels?,"This letter considers a two-panel massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with two antenna panels that may use different frequency bands for communication. By exploiting the geometric relationships between antenna panels, efficient channel inference methods across antenna panels are proposed to reduce the overhead of real-time channel estimation. Four scenarios are considered, namely far-field free-space, near-field free-space, multi-path sharing far-field scatterers, and multi-path sharing near-field scatterers. For both far-field and near-field free-space scenarios, we show that the channel of one panel can be fully inferred from that of the other panel, as long as the multi-path components (MPCs) composing the channel can be resolved. On the other hand, for the multi-path scenarios sharing far-field or near-field scatterers, only the angles or range of angles of the MPCs can be inferred, respectively. Simulation results based on commercial 3D ray-tracing software are presented to validate our developed channel inference techniques."
frequency-doppler division multiplexing modulation—a waveform design for high doppler communications,"This letter presents a novel multicarrier waveform scheme for high Doppler communications, referred to as frequency-Doppler (FD) division multiplexing (FDDM). The FDDM enables the conversion of the time-varying channel representation in the time-frequency (TF) domain to a static FD domain channel composed of independent Doppler taps. Distinguished from orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), FDDM modulates symbols in the FD domain, entailing each symbol to be spread over the entire frame time. Thus, the Doppler diversity can be achieved when a maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector is employed at the receiver. Simulation results show that FDDM outperforms OFDM in high-mobility scenarios. Moreover, the FDDM scheme has been shown to achieve comparable performance to the two-step orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) approach as well as a better adaptability to the well-established TF domain techniques compared to some low-complexity OTFS implementations."
transmit power minimization for ris-assisted mimo-noma system,"Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), especially the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs), can be integrated with multiple-input mutiple output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve coverage and save power usage. In this letter, we investigate a RIS-MIMO-NOMA system in a certain scenario, with focus on the system’s power consumption. To be specific, instead of the traditional clustering-based inter-user NOMA, inter-group NOMA is proposed to reduce total transmit power of RIS-MIMO-NOMA system. In order to solve the power minimization problem, the beamforming and phase shifts optimization are jointly designed. To address the beamforming optimization problem, the MMSE filters are exploited and iterative method is adopted, and in order to optimize phases, sequential rotation (SR) scheme is proposed. The numerical simulation results reveal the connection between the system’s parameters and overall transmit power, and show that for RIS-MIMO-NOMA system, the novel inter-group NOMA scheme is better than traditional clustering-based inter-user NOMA scheme in the total power consumption."
fast multibeam training for ris-assisted millimeter wave massive mimo,"For reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted mmWave massive MIMO, we propose a fast multibeam training (FMT) scheme with two stages. In the first stage, we find a multibeam together with the RIS reflection coefficients best matching the LoS links or the cascaded LoS links, where all the RISs use the same reflection coefficients at the same time to reduce the overhead of beam training. In the second stage, we find a DFT codeword best matching the LoS links or the cascaded LoS links for the BS instead of the multibeam. Different from the FMT scheme that uses a single-layer DFT codebook, in the proposed fast hierarchical multibeam training (FHMT) scheme we use a multi-layer hierarchical codebook, where in each layer only two wide beams are used to cover the angle space of interest, and the wide beams are narrowed down from top layer to bottom layer. Simulation results show that significantly smaller training overhead can be achieved by the FMT and FHMT schemes than the baseline scheme with slightly worse performance."
environment topology oriented fingerprint localization in indoor nlos scenarios,"Previous studies in fingerprint localization have primarily used feature comparison for user equipments’ (UEs’) position estimation. The estimation accuracies heavily rely on the constructed feature and its sampled resolution. This work presents an environment-oriented fingerprint localization scheme in an indoor non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario, which first finds the locations of scatters that reflect signals from the base station (BS) to UEs. Given the locations of BS and scatters, we match each scatter with the estimated time-of-arrivals (ToAs) of the BS-scatter-UE links. This allows us to compute the ToAs from the scatters to UEs and convert the NLoS localization problem into a line-of-sight (LoS) one. Simulation results demonstrate that we can estimate the scatters’ positions with centimeter-level accuracy and about 90% of 1000 uniformly distributed UEs have localization errors less than 0.8m."
tdoa-based decisions gathering scheme for optical wireless sensor networks,"This letter introduces an innovative decision-gathering scheme for an Optical Wireless Sensor Network (OWSN) with the primary goal of minimizing the decision error rate (DER). The proposed scheme implies that each sensor node is equipped with a Corner Cube Reflector (CCR), which according to its local decision, reflects the optical beam back to the Fusion Center (FC) or circulates it to another node. Then, the FC employs the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) method to identify the local decisions of nodes and generate a global decision. A closed-form expression of the DER in terms of false-alarm and miss-detection rates is derived. Additionally, comparative assessments via Matlab simulation against state-of-the-art reporting schemes are conducted. The analytical and simulation results of this letter reveal a noteworthy enhancement in DER of the proposed scheme at high numbers of nodes and low levels of signal power, demonstrating a substantial superiority over their counterparts of reporting schemes."
accelerating pro-admm-hl penalized algorithm for decoding binary ldpc codes,"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach to decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes has garnered lots of attention due to its superior error correction performance in error floor regions. However, improving convergence characteristic of ADMM decoding efficiently remains to be a crucial but challenging issue for practical application. In order to tackle this challenge, in this letter we first propose an efficient Pro-ADMM-based decoding algorithm framework by inserting additional quadratic proximal terms to each iteration of ADMM decoding for stabilizing the variable updates. Second, an message-passing interpretation of Pro-ADMM decoder is considered, and then an improved version based on horizontal layered scheduling, named Pro-ADMM-HL decoder is developed to further enhance the convergence behavior of Pro-ADMM decoding. Additionally, we analyze that the complexity of the proposed Pro-ADMM-HL decoders at each iteration displays linearly to LDPC code length. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed Pro-ADMM and Pro-ADMM-HL decoding algorithm in terms of error correction performance and convergence characteristic is demonstrated by simulation results."
a radio frequency fingerprinting scheme using learnable signal representation,"Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting is a promising technique for device authentication due to its advantages of difficult-to-tamper and inimitableness. Rather than employing hand-crafted features, deep learning-based methods that learn low-level signal representation from raw signals have been explored recently. This letter proposes a novel RF fingerprinting scheme using learnable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of representing radio signals by spectrograms from a fixed STFT and processing signal representation and classification separately, this approach integrates a parameterized STFT-based signal representation module and a CNN classifier into a single framework. The signal representation module is jointly trained with the CNN classifier using a single identification loss, transforming the input radio signals into spectrograms desired by the CNN classifier. Experimental results show that the RF fingerprint identification accuracy of the proposed scheme with learnable signal representation is significantly improved compared to baseline schemes with traditional hand-crafted signal representations."

Non-coherent detection of CPM is promising in real applications, as carrier phase recovery is not necessary. However, there is a performance gap between the non-coherent and coherent detections, especially for partial response CPM. In this letter, a non-coherent phase-compensated sphere detector (PC-SD) is proposed. Under a same observation length, the proposed non-coherent PC-SD significantly outperforms the conventional non-coherent maximum-likelihood detector for partial response CPM, with a much lower computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed non-coherent PC-SD also outperforms the state-of-the-art delay-optimized differential detector, and reduces the gap between non-coherent and coherent detectors to only 1 dB. Finally, the proposed non-coherent PC-SD is very robust against Doppler shift."
channel estimation for ris assisted thz systems with beam split,"Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered to be a promising technology for future terahertz (THz) communications. However, due to ultra bandwidth and large scale of antenna arrays at base station and RIS, RIS-assisted THz communication would suffer from severe beam split effect, which poses significant challenges in channel estimation. In this letter, we propose a novel cascaded channel estimation scheme, i.e. regularized sensing beam split based orthogonal matching pursuit (RSBS-OMP) for a practical RIS-assisted wideband THz multi-user system. The cascade channel estimation is formulated as a sparse parameter recovery problem and RSBS-OMP algorithm is utilized to estimate channel parameters. Numerical simulations show that performance of the proposed RSBS-OMP method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of normalized mean-square-error."
intelligent reflecting surface-assisted caching cellular network in an urban environment: access strategy and success probability analysis,"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), as an emerging hardware which could reflect signals towards any direction, is suitable for improving network coverage in urban environments. In this letter, we combine blockages with IRS and design a mechanism for signals to cross blockages, thereby establishing a “base station-blockage-user” cascaded channel. To analyze the network performance, we use stochastic geometry to model urban networks and analyze the access strategies of typical users, along with the access distance and communication success probability under specific access situations. Meanwhile, we introduce caching mechanism in the network to analyze the impact of complex interference caused by different caching situations. Based on numerical results, we find that the more IRS elements there are, the greater the possibility of access through the IRS. Furthermore, we discover that the quality of communication will not always improve with higher base station density due to the enhancement of interference signals. Moreover, under the popularity model adopted in this letter, we find that a more skewed caching policy will achieve better performance."

In order to investigate short-packet transmissions in SR system, both direct and backscatter signal packets are considered to have finite blocklength. According to different modulation schemes on RIS, we investigate the ON/OFF-based reflection and binary phase shift keying modulation schemes, and attain the average achievable rates of the SR system. Then, an energy efficiency maximization optimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming vector at the base station and the phase shift matrix at the RIS. Finally, we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework to solve this non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based framework can achieve higher energy efficiency and better convergence performance than the current DRL-based framework."
flag vector assisted multi-user semantic communications for downlink text transmission,"Semantic communication has become a promising paradigm tailored for multi-user intelligent communications. Existing semantic methods for multi-user schemes assume that the receiver sends channel state information (CSI) feedback to the transmitter, which is not always realistic. In this work, we design a feedback-free scheme called Multi-user Efficient Transmission DeepSC (MET_DeepSC) for multi-user semantic communication. The idea is to utilize dedicated flag vectors for the identification of different users. We embed these flag vectors on both the transmitter and receiver sides, and thus the feedback of CSI is no longer needed. We also propose a fusion mechanism that compresses the semantic messages of all the users into a single signal. In this way, all the users’ messages can be simultaneously sent, relieving the transmission workload. Simulation results show that the MET_DeepSC transmits multi-user messages without additional resources at the cost of only slight performance degradation and outperforms the baselines."

We propose a moment-based estimator that exploits the 2nd and 4th-order moments of simultaneously the envelope and the complex values of the received signal. We show that the suggested estimator outperforms existing 2nd and 4th-order moment-based estimators and that it achieves asymptotically the non-data-aided normalized Cramér–Rao lower bound (NDA-NCRLB). Besides, we analytically justify the performance of the suggested estimator with respect to classical estimators, including in the presence of residual phase noise."

The intelligent detector is designed by unfolding the OAMP detector with adding several learnable parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that, with much reduced complexity and much fewer parameters, the proposed detector can achieve better error performance under channel estimation errors compared with other nonlinear detectors."
direction estimation of the attacked signal in pbch of 5g nr,"This letter investigates the jamming attack in the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) of the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) that conveys critical information of the cell called master information block (MIB). Since smart attack on PBCH is simply possible using the information of synchronization signal block (SSB) that is unencrypted during the initial access, this channel is one of the most effective choices from a jammer’s point of view. In this study, we propose a hypothesis test to detect the presence of a jamming attack in the PBCH block and, furthermore, we estimate the principal direction of the attacked PBCH demodulation reference signal (PBCH DMRS) that significantly deviates under that attack. These achievements are also presented in the form of semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation. PBCH DMRS is located at 25% of the PBCH block and is vital for PBCH extraction to initiate a radio connection between user and an appropriate cell. Simulation results evaluate the proposed method in various aspects and prove its superiority over the recent competing methods."

In this letter, dictionary theory is applied to signal design and a dictionary-theory-based orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (Dic-OCDM) signal is proposed. The geometric transformations for constructing the structured dictionary are used to construct the modulation matrix of the Dic-OCDM. The generated Dic-OCDM signal has a larger subcarrier spacing and thus is more tolerant to Doppler expansion. Simulation results show that the proposed Dic-OCDM signal can effectively improve the communication performance with similar detection performance compared to the OCDM signal."

Then, after analyzing the performance of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) in the scenario with integrated model mismatch, an iterative Toeplitz preprocessing method is proposed for the MUSIC algorithm to maintain the Toeplitz property during obtaining the covariance matrix of the received signals. Finally, simulation results are given to show the estimation performance, and a prototype system is tested in the anechoic chamber. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in the scenario with model mismatches."
fair wireless federated learning through the identification of a common descent direction,"In Federated Learning (FL), varying local dataset distributions among clients can result in unsatisfactory performance for some, leading to an unfair model. While some prior works attempted to resolve this issue, their approaches fall short of training a fair model in real-world scenarios where imperfections in wireless channels cause the server to receive noisy versions of local updates. To tackle this issue, in this letter, we treat FL as a multi-objective minimization problem, and develop a fair FL algorithm that explicitly accounts for the inherent imperfections of wireless channels. Particularly, we modify the classical multiple gradient descent algorithm to assist the server in identifying a common descent direction for all local objectives based on the received noisy gradients. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method via some experiments."
enhanced joint source-channel polarization effect based on polarizing matrix extension,"In this letter, we propose a joint source-channel coding scheme based on polarizing matrix extension (PME-JSCC). The PME-JSCC can combine channel received signal and source side information to form a longer polar code. We extend the source encoding matrix and place channel bits on the extended bits. Due to the lower triangular structure of the polarizing matrix, source bits will not be changed by channel bits. The PME-JSCC can obtain enhanced joint source-channel polarization (JSCP) effect. This effect enhances the reliabilities of both channel bits and source encoded bits simultaneously. The bound on the block error probability for PME-JSCC is improved. And the PME-JSCC can be proved to reach the fundamental limit on JSCC. Simulation results show that the PME-JSCC scheme outperforms the DP-LDPC and the D-Polar codes under the joint successive cancellation list (J-SCL) decoder and can approximate the JSCC finite length bound in the short blocklength regime."

The traditional matching pursuit algorithm over GF(2) is susceptible to mismatching and cause a chain of errors. To overcome this problem, two strategies are proposed, one is to introduce a kind of new matching reliability, and the other is to adopt a scheme of multiple decoding modules. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only greatly outperforms the bit-flipping (BF) algorithm, but also outperforms the hybrid soft-decision algorithm such as weighted BF algorithm in error performance, and has the advantage of low complexity."
reed-solomon coded probabilistic constellation shaping for molecular communications,"Probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) is a promising technique employed in molecular communications, utilizing molecular shell mapping (MSM). However, the performance of MSM, particularly its bit error rate (BER), falls short when the exact channel state information is unavailable. To address this challenge and enhance robustness, we propose a scheme known as Reed-Solomon coded PCS (RS-PCS) scheme. This approach combines shaping and coding through a parallel transmitter structure, preserving the shaped distribution at the output of the RS encoder. In addition, we develop a low-complexity receiver that leverages the intra-sequence interference. Our numerical results on BER clearly demonstrate that the proposed RS-PCS scheme outperforms existing schemes that only consider the PCS or RS coding techniques alone."

SW-NOBA is devised to tackle inter-priority collisions, while minimizing instances of intra-priority collisions. Its adaptive nature, dynamically responding to channel conditions influenced by factors such as node density, collision occurrences, and successful data transmissions, allows SW-NOBA to enhance the overall utilization of superframes. Evaluating SW-NOBA’s efficacy involves a comparative analysis with two benchmarks: the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) and the traditional Non-Overlapping Backoff Algorithm (NOBA). The findings demonstrate that SW-NOBA significantly amplifies superframe utilization.

In this study, we propose a novel signal-processing algorithm for improving the physical layer security of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN). The proposed algorithm is based on utilizing the atmospheric signature associated with the received signal at the ground station that causes rapid variations in the signal. We leverage the characteristics of spatial time-frequency signature caused by atmospheric channel associated with incoming signals at the ground station from different satellites to differentiate among the sources from which the signal has been transmitted. The various parameters extracted from the rapidly varying signal component are then provided as inputs to the machine learning algorithm for detecting the legitimate satellite. The algorithm is validated against the measured data obtained at a site located in Israel.

Second, we determine the occurrence of burst errors based on the weight of error pattern, and identify the position and length of the burst error using a sliding window search method. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions of the detection probability and false alarm probability for burst error detection was derived. Finally, numerical and simulation results demonstrated that the proposed erasure-aware technique based on estimated or empirically determined threshold achieves significant performance gain over the conventional erasure-agnostic one."

The proposed system model ensures data privacy and energy self-sustainability of wireless (e.g., sensory, sensing or data gathering) devices involved in collaborative machine learning regardless of the specific FL algorithm. We specifically aim to minimize the total training duration of the FL process by properly allocating the communication resources (i.e., durations of energy harvesting, local processing and transmission phases, and transmit powers), the computational parameters of the EH clients (i.e. CPU frequencies) and learning parameters of their FL models (i.e. local training error threshold). We derive analytical solutions for these parameters, resulting in low complexity in implementing the proposed scheme."

enhanced message-passing decoding of degenerate quantum codes utilizing trapping set dynamics,"In this letter, we propose a novel iterative decoding algorithm that exploits the degenerate nature of three different families of quantum low-density parity-check codes, i.e., surface, toric, and row-degree-4 bicycle codes. Such families of codes share harmful trapping sets that constitute symmetric stabilizers, making it impossible for any parallel-scheduled iterative message-passing decoder to converge even for error patterns of weight as low as two. By biasing subsets of nodes in the symmetric stabilizers, the decoder is able to converge to a valid error pattern. Furthermore, the proposed decoder has low decoding complexity - linear in the code’s blocklength - and a fully parallel schedule, making it suitable for low-latency efficient implementation."

The beamforming vectors are constructed to approximate a desired angle gain mask by using a low complexity iterative coordinated phase matching. By employing simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed beamforming design using low resolution phase shifters only has a slight performance loss than existing low resolution and even some high resolution schemes, while the complexity predominately reduces. The robustness performance in angle information error supports the implementation of the angle-based approach."
belief propagation decoding for short-length codes based on sparse tanner graph,"In this letter, we present a novel approach to improve belief propagation (BP) decoding performance by sparsifying the Tanner graph. Our proposed method first constructs a low-weight parity-check (LWPC) matrix with increased rows based on the original parity-check matrix. Then, all 4-cycles in the LWPC matrix are eliminated by adding auxiliary variable nodes and corresponding parity-check rows, resulting in the generalized LWPC (G-LWPC) matrix. Compared to the original matrix, the sparsity is greatly improved without altering the encoding constraints. Simulation results show that BP decoding based on the G-LWPC matrix is particularly effective for short code lengths. For a (128, 20) polar code with 24-bit cyclic redundancy check, our proposed G-LWPC matrix reduces the density from 17.4% to 1.3%, and with 10 iterations, BP decoding can achieve the performance of successive cancellation list decoding with a list size of 32."

To ensure the accessing rate of legal user, high key generation rate (KGR) and low key disagreement rate (KDR) are critical. We first utilize instantaneous channel information of demodulation reference signal to rapidly generate key without frequently information exchanging in PHY. Then, to reduce the inconsistency of the generated PHY key caused by high-frequency noise, discrete wavelet transform is used to decrease the KDR. Furthermore, the theoretical KGR upper bound of the proposed scheme is derived from the aspect of information theory. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified in OpenAirInterface platform. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has the high accessing rate of legal user and low-delay, which effectively protects the random access procedure from unauthorized user."

However, realizing efficient and secure computation offloading is challenging due to the limited storage capacity of MEC servers and the offloading security issue arising from the open nature of wireless channels. In this letter, we investigate a MEC network with an eavesdropper, where the MEC server caches service programs required for task execution. Moreover, we propose a cooperative jamming-assisted scheme to enhance the security of computation offloading, in which a friendly jammer actively transmits signals to disrupt eavesdropping. Considering the limited caching capacity of the MEC server and the security concerns of computation offloading, we formulate a delay minimization problem by jointly optimizing service caching placement, transmit power, and devices’ computation offloading decisions. To tackle this problem, we develop an efficient layered algorithm using successive convex approximation and the cross entropy-based technique. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in reducing the overall delay in completing devices’ computation tasks compared to baseline schemes."

The performance of PLA in this scenario suffers from the inaccurate prediction of the channel statement information (CSI) owing to the Doppler shifts and multipath fading. To overcome the difficulty, a model-driven learning algorithm is developed to predict dynamic CSI. Specifically, the Bahdanau Attention Autoencoder (BAAE)-based PLA scheme is proposed to extract relevant channel features and mitigate inter-symbol interference and inter-carrier interference. Compared to existing deep learning-based PLA schemes, the proposed scheme addresses the core factors contributing to poor authentication accuracy at the algorithmic level, rather than brute-force learning from bigger datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme presents more accurate predictions and lower complexity compared with the existing data-driven models across all tested signal noise ratio levels and velocities. Moreover, it is robust to maintain 99.6% authentication accuracy even when the users are moving with high velocities."

However, the detector and decoder for LDPC-DDMC systems are treated separately in prior investigations, which cannot fully exploit the joint sparsity brought by the delay-Doppler channel and parity-check matrix. To promote the performance and reduce the complexity further, the detector and decoder of LDPC-DDMC systems are connected in a factor graph as two modules in this letter. The parallel belief propagation (BP)-based approach is then proposed to establish the joint receiver design for LDPC-DDMC systems with low complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme enjoys better bit-error-rate (BER) performance compared with the separate design."

However, the issue of DL-based receiver design in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) has often been disregarded and not adequately addressed. In this letter, we propose a model-driven DL-based receiver for an OFDM system with CFO. Drawing upon the state evolution theory, we establish a convex function that correlates the energy of the estimated channel with the residual CFO. Subsequently, we develop a CFO estimation technique by maximizing the estimated channel energy. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, we propose a joint CFO and channel estimation algorithm based on the ternary search method. Additionally, we propose a model-driven DL-based receiver based on the highly accurate CFO and channel estimation. Despite slightly higher complexity, our proposed receiver outperforms existing methods and approaches the performance limit attainable in the absence of CFO, thereby highlighting its superiority."

Then, the interference suppressing multi-user zero-forcing (IS-MU-ZF) is considered to further eliminate the inter-cluster interference. But the IS-MU-ZF faces a capacity drop problem. Thus, an adaptive interfering user selection method is proposed to flexibly determine the set of interfering users for each user-cluster. It is confirmed by computer simulation that the proposed CC-based CF-mMIMO system utilizing the IS-MU-ZF with the proposed adaptive interfering user selection method outperforms the well-known user-centric (UC)-based CF-mMIMO system in terms of capacity and computational complexity when the accuracy of channel estimation is guaranteed."

Specifically, the OTFS-RSMA scheme pairs one high-speed user with one low-speed user for cross-domain transmission using RSMA. To further enhance outage performance and user fairness, two kinds of Cognitive Radio (CR) Rate Splitting (RS) detection strategies are applied, that is, the CR for low-speed user splitting (CR-L) and CR for high-speed user splitting (CR-H), respectively. Furthermore, a modified Atkinson index is proposed to evaluate user fairness.

Among all AI frameworks, split learning (SL) partitions the AI model into device-side and server-side components, distributing them at both wireless device and edge server. Depending on the number of split layers, there exist a trade-off between the computation and communication costs. Until now, the impact of the wireless channel attenuation on the SL performance and impact of SL on the communication cost have been rarely studied, not to mention capturing these impacts in a practical testbed.

This letter proposes an integrated approach that combines Constraint-Driven Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means (T2FCM) clustering and the step-wise gossip algorithm to overcome the challenges of communication congestion in peer-to-peer distributed networks. Traditional clustering algorithms often lack accuracy and relevance in organizing and analyzing large volumes of data in nodes. To address this, the integration of T2FCM clustering, which incorporates domain-specific constraints, is introduced to improve clustering accuracy. Additionally, the transition state theory based step-wise gossip algorithm is utilized to adjust information transfer rates, enhancing scalability, fault tolerance, and resource utilization while reducing communication congestion. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving low latency access. By leveraging accurate clustering results and adjusting information transfer rates, the overall performance of fusion transmission in peer-to-peer networks is significantly improved."
semantic-enhanced downlink leo satellite communication system with otfs modulation,"As an important technology for achieving 6G global access, low Earth orbit satellite (LEO-Sat) communication still encounters the challenges of scarce spectrum resources and the serious Doppler effect. To improve the performance of image transmission in the LEO-Sat system, this letter proposes an approach that combines semantic communication with orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation to effectively mitigate the severe Doppler effect and enhance transmission efficiency. The NTN-TDL-D model in 3GPP is employed to simulate satellite channels and introduce noise into the training process of the semantic model. The performance of semantic-enhanced and traditional LEO-Sat systems is further evaluated under various conditions. Ultimately, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a minimum 6dB signal-to-noise ratio gain, reduces communication overhead by 50%, and ensures higher spectrum utilization efficiency in high-speed scenarios compared to existing solutions."

Our work designs a channel and delay weighted response ratio (CDRR) scheduler for coexisting heterogeneous real-time (RT) enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. We develop a novel prioritization function with a numerical bound analysis of the delay budgets, packet sizes and channel conditions in a 5G setting. The proposed scheduler outperforms modern schedulers with a significant reduction in the average RT queuing delay. It supports higher RT traffic densities by providing the lowest mean packet-dropping ratio at high reliability."
contrastive learning-based multimodal fusion model for automatic modulation recognition,"Multimodal fusion-based methods are a research hotspot for Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR). But the existing methods primarily emphasize information integration and neglect the balance between the modalities. This letter proposes a novel Contrastive Learning-based Multimodal Fusion (CLMF) model, which integrates both signals and key features to enhance AMR. To obtain adequate signal representations, a contrastive learning architecture is proposed to learn the meaningful representations from the multimodal fusion data, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is incorporated for precise signal classification. Moreover, a threshold discrimination disturbance strategy is designed to balance the information conflicts arising from the two modalities. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the CLMF model for AMR on the public dataset."
estimation of cascaded sparse channel for irs-assisted millimeter wave hybrid mimo system,"A promising strategy for next-generation wireless communication systems in pursuit of ultra-high information speed and extended coverage involves the synergistic integration of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) with millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output (mmWave MIMO) systems. However, realizing the full potential of IRS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems necessitates precise channel state information (CSI). Existing CSI estimation methods for IRS-assisted mmWave hybrid (analog+digital) MIMO systems, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), require substantial number of pilots and exhibit high computational complexity due to their offline nature and requires matrix inversions. Consequently, these characteristics offer significant estimation delays and reduced spectral efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose an online variable step size zero attracting least mean square-based channel estimator to overcome the limitations of existing estimators. Moreover, we compare the accuracy of the proposed method with existing OMP, SBL, and oracle least squares (LSs) method, which is used for benchmarking purpose. Simulation results are presented to validate effectiveness of the suggested estimator in terms of accuracy, complexity, and pilot overhead requirements."

This letter focuses on optimal frequency control for energy consumption minimization under application completion delay constraint. To design low-complexity optimal algorithms, we transform the application delay constraint to path delay constraints. Considering a special case of problems with a single path delay constraint (SPDC), a water-filling algorithm termed as WF-SPDC is proposed. When generalizing to problems with multiple intersected path delay constraints (MIPDC), we propose an ADMM-WF-MIPDC algorithm by utilizing the ADMM method and WF-SPDC. Nume- rical results also verify the optimality of our proposed algorithms."
turbulent single-scattering channel model for ultraviolet communications using equivalent scattering point approach,"None-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) communication has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The atmospheric turbulence will deteriorate the performance of NLOS UV communications. Existing works on the turbulent model of NLOS UV single-scattering channels only considered the narrow beam cases. In this letter, we propose a turbulent channel model using the equivalent scattering points (ESPs) approach to characterize the fluctuation effect on UV signals under large full-width beam divergence angles and field-of-view angles. An analytical turbulent scintillation index is derived considering the turbulent correlation between different ESPs and is verified by its numerical solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the turbulent scintillation index will increase with the turbulent correlation distance. Besides, we demonstrate that a large common volume can mitigate the turbulent fluctuation effect on UV communications, which can be explained by an “equivalent spatial diversity effect” due to the large common volume."
security-reliability tradeoff in uav-carried active ris-assisted cooperative networks,"In this letter, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cooperative network (UARCN) with a source (S), a trustworthy user (U), and an untrustworthy user (E), which is bridged by multiple half-duplex decode-and-forward relays and an active RIS mounted on a hovering UAV. In the UARCN, both U, E, and relays receive the signal from S through the active RIS merely in the first time slot; then one out of the successful decoding relays is selected to further transmit information via the direct link and RIS in the second time slot. The outage probability and intercept probability are jointly analyzed to investigate the security and reliability tradeoff (SRT) of the system. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis, revealing that the active RIS can bring greater improvement to the system SRT than passive or hybrid RIS, and its location can be further optimized."
ber analysis of multi-user noma networks in the presence of interference,"This letter considers a multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system in the presence of arbitrary co- channel interference (CCI) signals. Taking into account the precise statistics of the self-interference signals of NOMA users, it derives a new unified expression for the bit error rate (BER) of an arbitrary number of users. The users may employ various modulation schemes and orders, including M-ary pulse amplitude modulation with arbitrary orders, M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation with arbitrary orders, or a combination of both with arbitrary orders. The newly derived expression is then applied to a multi-user NOMA in two different interference scenarios: 1) fixed located CCI, and 2) Poisson point process-based randomly located CCI. The preciseness of the BER expression for different number of users and modulation schemes/orders is verified via numerical and simulation results."

This study investigates the performance of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled multi-user UOWC systems operating over an exponential-generalized gamma-distributed oceanic turbulence channel with pointing errors. An accurate analytical expression for the sum ergodic capacity is derived, and a particle swarm optimization-based alternative-search algorithm is developed to jointly optimize both transmit power allocation and the position of the source node for maximizing the sum ergodic capacity. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maximizing system capacity over several benchmark schemes is verified via extensive simulations."
orthogonal space–time block code based over-the-air computation in backscatter sensor networks,"In backscatter sensor networks, performing over-the-air computation (AirComp) is challenging, because backscatter devices are impossible to accomplish channel estimation and precoding operations to offset the distortions caused by wireless channels. In this letter, we propose an orthogonal space-time block code based AirComp scheme for a monostatic backscatter AirComp network. To minimize the computation mean square error while satisfying energy harvesting constraints, we also propose a Rayleigh quotient based globally optimal power splitting ratios. Simulation results are provided to show that our proposed optimal power splitting ratios outperform the maximum, channel inversion, and random power splitting ratios."
hierarchical beamforming for broadcast channels,"For massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) cellular communications, the conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based beamforming yields narrow beams of high directional gain, but it usually requires too many time slots for sweeping the beams to broadcast common messages. To reduce the time of beam sweeping while maintaining sufficient beamforming gain, this letter proposes a hierarchical beamforming (HierBF) scheme. By partitioning a large uniform rectangular array (URA) into multiple sub-URAs, first we apply the omnidirectional beamforming (OBF) to each sub-URA to transform it into a virtual high-power antenna, thus, the large URA is virtually transformed into a smaller array; second we apply the DFT codebook on the smaller virtual array to obtain wider beams, thus, the beam sweeping can be completed in fewer time slots. The HierBF scheme can accommodate to more flexible antenna array sizes than a similar technique termed array-size invariant (ASI). Besides, the HierBF scheme has a complexity of ${\mathcal{ O}}(1)$ , and can be implemented using an analog phase shifter network (PSN) with a coarse phase resolution."
a transformer and convolution-based learning framework for automatic modulation classification,"Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a typical pattern classification task that is an intermediate process between signal detection and demodulation. Deep learning methods used in AMC, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) have their shortcomings. We propose a new parallel CNN transformer network (PCTNet), which not only possesses the advantages of transformer to capture long-range dependencies, but also utilizes the advantages of CNN to extract local information. PCTNet is a parallel design of CNN and transformer, with a delivery mechanism in the middle. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed PCTNet can achieve superior classification performance than traditional deep models."
neural self-corrected min-sum decoder for nr ldpc codes,"In this letter, a neural self-corrected min-sum (NSCMS) decoder is proposed for 5G new radio (NR) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Training in real-time on a rapidly changing channel requires low latency and minimal resource utilization. Unfortunately, typical neural decoders for LDPC codes use large and deep neural networks proportional to the code length, leading to latency and resource problems. In the network of NSCMS similar to network model pruning, certain nodes meeting the self correction condition are deleted and excluded from learning. This reduces the computational complexity of learning, compared to conventional networks. Thus, the NSCMS decoder has high practicality in real-time training using machine learning. Furthermore, self-correction allows for more reliable message-based learning and significantly improves performance. Simulation results demonstrate that NSCMS decoders exhibit lower error rates than previously proposed min-sum decoders."
a three-level federated learning framework for csi fingerprint based indoor localization in multiple servers environment,"This letter develops a federated learning (FL) framework for indoor localization using channel state information (CSI) fingerprint, aiming to (a) design a FL framework for multiple servers which can protect data privacy, improve data transmission quality and enlarge the coverage area of global server (b) maximize localization performance under the given measurement data. To this end, we first propose a three-level FL framework where the FL is processed between client and intermediate server, intermediate server and intermediate server, intermediate server and global server, respectively. Then, the training accuracy based model aggregation is proposed for first and second level of FL. In order to accelerate the convergence, the inner production based aggregation rule is used for the last level FL processing. After the model aggregation, in order to protect data privacy, the obtained model parameters are sent to the given local client connected with the intermediate server. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed scheme has better localization performance than some existing approaches under two different scenarios."

Integrating fluid antenna (FA) technology into MEC networks provides a new approach to address this challenge. This letter proposes an FA-enabled MEC scheme that aims to minimize the total system delay by leveraging the mobility of FA to enhance channel conditions and improve computational offloading efficiency. By establishing an optimization problem focusing on the joint optimization of computation offloading and antenna positioning, we introduce an alternating iterative algorithm based on the interior point method and particle swarm optimization (IPPSO). Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme compared to traditional fixed antenna positions, showing significant improvements in transmission rates and reductions in delays. The proposed IPPSO algorithm exhibits robust convergence properties, further validating the effectiveness of our method."

Subsequently, two novel approximations for the noncoherent detection probability of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with approximately orthogonal transmitted signals are deduced utilizing the PDF-based and MGF-based approaches. The accuracy of the proposed approximations is confirmed numerically by Monte Carlo simulations."
multi-agent reinforcement learning charging scheme for underwater rechargeable sensor networks,"Multiple underwater mobile chargers (UMCs) charging the sensor nodes (SNs) in underwater rechargeable sensor network (URSN) is very challenging due to the unique underwater environment, UMC moving characteristics and the cooperation among multiple UMCs. The existing studies have no address on multi-UMC cooperation and global balance of URSN charging efficiency. This letter proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning scheme for multi-UMC charging underwater SNs (MARLCS). The URSNs charging effect indicators are designed, and the reward model aims to maximize underwater SNs survival rate and UMC energy efficiency, which is NP-hard and high-dimensional. Then a distributed actor-critic solution is defined to utilize the global information from UMCs and make effective multi-UMC charging decision. The experimental results show that MARLCS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art schemes, and reduces the number of dead underwater SNs as well as saves the energy of UMCs efficiently."
papr reduction for fbmc-oqam system with laplace-based linear companding transform,"The filter-bank multi-carrier (FBMC) with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) is considered a promising waveform for 5G due to its favorable frequency-time localization and efficient spectrum utilization. However, the specific overlapping structure and multi-carrier nature of FBMC-OQAM waveforms result in an exceptionally high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). To address this issue, this letter introduces a linear companding transform scheme tailored for FBMC-OQAM waveforms to reduce the PAPR. Since, the unique modulation technique leads to a high probability of extreme amplitude occurrences in the FBMC-OQAM waveform, with the amplitude’s probability density function closely resembling a Laplace distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution. We derive the companding gain expression for the FBMC-OQAM signal and establish a parameter division criterion suitable for the FBMC-OQAM waveform under the assumption of a Laplace distribution. The simulation results reveal that while upholding optimal bit error rate performance, the proposed scheme provides at least $58\% $ and $20\% $ performance advantages in PAPR reduction capability compared to the Gaussian distribution-based linear nonsymmetrical transform and linear companding transform schemes, respectively."
a new method for ldpc blind recognition over a candidate set using kullback-leibler divergence,"Blind recognition plays a very important role in both applications such as grant-free access by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and non-cooperative communication scenarios. Therefore, it has received more and more attention in recent years. In this letter, a new scheme is proposed to resolve the problem of blind low-density parity-check (LDPC) encoder recognition over a known candidate set. First, we measure the relationship between the received vectors and the rows of the parity-check matrices in the candidate set, which can be represented by different distributions depending on whether the parity-check relationships are satisfied or not. Then, we classify the LDPC encoder over the candidate set by employing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric for measuring the distance between these two distributions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm provides better recognition performance."

The SC-DP-LDPC code consists of a source spatially-coupled protograph-based low-density parity-check (SC-P-LDPC) code and a channel SC-P-LDPC code. Moreover, the two corresponding protomatrices are connected by a spatially-coupled source-check-channel-variable (SC-SCCV) linking protomatrix. Theoretical and simulation results show that the SC-DP-LDPC codes outperform JSCC systems based on state-of-the-art double protograph-based LDPC block codes or concatenated spatially-coupled LDPC codes."

In this letter, we propose a sorting-based soft-demapping (SSD) algorithm for LoRa systems. Our proposed algorithm reduces the complexity order of the soft-demapper from <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$\mathcal {O}(M\log _{2} M)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$\mathcal {O}(M)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$M=2^{\text {SF}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and SF represents the spreading factor, thus matching the complexity of hard decision. Importantly, this complexity reduction does not lead to any substantial performance degradation when compared to the Max-Log-MAP demapper. As a result, soft decoding can be employed in low-complexity LoRa systems to effectively enhance receiver sensitivity."

In the proposed precoding scheme, the matched filtering (MF) precodes the common message, while the private messages are preceded by zero-forcing (ZF). We derive the closed-form expression for the outage probability of the MF/ZF-based RSMA over Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, we also derive an analytical expression for the ergodic sum rate. In the end, numerical results are presented to validate the correctness of the derived expressions, as well as demonstrate the advantage of our proposed scheme."
efficient key extraction for secure vehicular communication through otfs,"Vehicular communication is delay sensitive and demands high security. However, the time for key establishment between node pairs is limited due to the unique features of fast-moving and high dynamics in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Moreover, under high-mobility scenarios, the communication performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals degrades significantly, while Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) signals maintains better performance. Towards this end, considering the time for key establishment, we propose an efficient physical layer secret key generation (PLSKG) scheme utilizing OTFS channel state information (CSI). First, we preprocess the estimated CSI with a moving average coding (MAC) algorithm to improve channel reciprocity. Next, we adopt a bidirectional difference quantization (BDQ) for increased key bit generation and propose a one-way reconciliation protocol to remove bit mismatch. Results from extensive simulations have verified that our scheme achieves random 0-b disagreement keys with a high key generation rate and reduced time for key establishment compared to other schemes."
base station beamforming design in near-field xl-irs beam training,"Existing research on extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) beam training has widely assumed the far-field channel model for the base station (BS)-IRS link. However, this approach may cause degraded beam training performance in practice due to the near-field channel model of the BS-IRS link. To address this issue, we propose two efficient schemes to optimize BS beamforming for improving the XL-IRS beam training performance. Specifically, the first scheme aims to maximize total received signal power on the XL-IRS, which generalizes the existing angle based BS beamforming design and can be resolved using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The second scheme aims to maximize the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm of incident signals on the XL-IRS, which is shown to achieve the maximum received power at the user. To solve the non-convex <inline-formula> <tex-math notation= LaTeX >$\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm maximization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm by using the alternating optimization (AO) technique. Numerical results show that the proposed AO based BS beamforming design outperforms the SVD/angle based BS beamforming in terms of success rate and achievable data rate."
continuous online learning-based csi feedback in massive mimo systems,"For massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) compression and feedback are crucial for enhancing system performance. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been designed and proven to perform well in this task. However, the distribution of CSI in real-world communication systems may differ from the one observed during model training, which can undermine the effectiveness of DL-based methods due to their limited generalization ability. Several methods have been proposed to facilitate online training and enable network adaptation to unknown scenarios. Nevertheless, the knowledge learned from previous scenarios is often forgotten, leading to performance degradation when encountering a previous scenario again. In this letter, we propose a novel continuous learning-based CSI feedback approach, which can effectively address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting and ensure consistent high performances across all historical scenarios, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of the model."
multi-user grouping for noma enabled vlc system,"Driven by the rapid growth of wireless devices and their need for innovative technologies to facilitate a Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) connectivity, visible light communication (VLC) has arisen as a candidate solution. However, the rapid growth of wireless devices necessitates the use of multiple access (MA) techniques to support multi-user Gbps connectivity. In this work, we consider non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as a candidate MA technique for the downlink VLC systems and focus on grouping multiple users so that they can share the same resources. For the same, we propose two multi-user grouping schemes, which exploit the principles of power domain NOMA by maximizing the channel gain differences across the users in a group. The analytical and empirical results corroborate that the proposed schemes can be utilized to group multiple users and improve the overall achievable sum rate."

This letter proposes a recognition scheme that combines time-frequency analysis with deep learning to overcome the degradation of recognizing multiple FH signals amidst complex electromagnetic interference. The scheme utilizes the synchroextracting transform to obtain the spectrogram of the mixed signal by aggregating the energy, then employs RFRM-CenterNet with enhanced small-object detection capability to extract the features and to precisely identify FH signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the scheme improves the accuracy and robustness of multiplexing FH recognition."
traffic-aware optimal multi-beam resource allocation in 5g networks impaired by rain and foliage,"In this letter, we study a traffic-aware multi-beam optimal resource allocation strategy for fixed home users who are serviced through the utilization of simultaneous multiple beams generated by next-generation node B (gNB). The strategy takes into account the effects of rain and foliage attenuation. We propose a graphical methodology that is combined with a closed-form expression to compute the optimal coverage radius of gNB. Afterwards, the k-means clustering algorithm is utilized to determine an optimal location for the gNB. In this study, we also present an approach that employs non-linear programming (NLP) to allocate power and bandwidth among individual beams, with an objective of satisfying the traffic requirements of each user. From the results, it is evident that our proposed approach exhibits superior performance in scenarios characterized by rain and foliage attenuation, in comparison to alternatives relying on genetic algorithms and surrogate optimization. approaches."
fluid antenna system enhancing orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access,"Fluid antenna system (FAS) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Unlike traditional antenna systems (TASs), FAS is a new wireless communication system where the so-called ‘fluid’ antenna (FA) can finely change its position within a given area. This unique ability allows FAS to harness additional diversity and multiplexing gains. In this letter, we investigate the applications of FAS in orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks for performance enhancement. Specifically, we maximize the sum-rate of these multiple access schemes via optimal port selection and power allocation subject to per-user rate requirement. We then obtain the optimal variables in closed-form expressions. Our results reveal that FAS significantly improves the sum-rate of OMA and NOMA when compared to TAS. More interestingly, we discover that it is possible for FAS without channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) to outperform optimal TAS with CSIT."

To alleviate the user interference at the legitimate receiver, we propose a novel pairing scheme based on double-threshold (DT) of covert communication channel gain. For the proposed scheme, the covertness constraint, the transmission outage probability from covert and public users to legitimate receiver are derived, which reveal the impacts of SIC and pairing threshold on the communication covertness and reliability. Simulation results are provided to prove our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DT pairing scheme in terms of effective covert rate (ECR). In addition, numerical results show the impacts of pairing threshold and warden’s SIC on the covert communication design where the equal prior probabilities for covert user and the maximal transmit power for the public user are generally not optimal to maximize ECR."

Inspired by recent constructions of Golay-ZCZ sequences by Chen and Wu, we focus on a new direct construction of Golay-ZCZ sequences with lower PAPR based on generalized Boolean functions (GBFs). The proposed construction leads to a family of cyclically shift distinct ZCZ sequences for which each resultant sequence is also a Golay sequence thus yields PAPR of at most 2."

The pre-filters are optimized to minimize the length of the impulse response of the equivalent channel while promoting its output signal power. Simulation results demonstrate that when the number of transmit antennas is 2 or more, the length of CP can be shortened to 0 and the bit error rate is very close to that of the MRT scheme with full-length CP and is lower obviously than that of the basic time reversal (TR) filtering scheme with full-length CP."
