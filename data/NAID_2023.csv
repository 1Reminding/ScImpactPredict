Transformers have contributed to the development of graph reasoning algorithms

Graph Agent (GA), an intelligent agent methodology of leveraging large language

knowledge graph reasoning tasks. GA integrates aspects of symbolic reasoning
and existing graph embedding methods to provide an innovative approach for
complex graph reasoning tasks. By converting graph structures into textual

human-interpretable explanations. The effectiveness of the GA was evaluated on
node classification and link prediction tasks. Results showed that GA reached
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating accuracy of 90.65%, 95.48%, and

wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been the subject of
extensive research. Although instruction tuning has proven to be a
data-efficient method for transforming LLMs into such generalist models, their
performance still lags behind specialist models trained exclusively for
specific tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating
broad-coverage generalist instruction tuning can contribute to building a
specialist model. We hypothesize that its efficacy depends on task specificity
and skill requirements. Our experiments assess four target tasks with distinct
coverage levels, revealing that integrating generalist instruction tuning
consistently enhances model performance when the task coverage is broad. The
effect is particularly pronounced when the amount of task-specific training
data is limited. Further investigation into three target tasks focusing on
different capabilities demonstrates that generalist instruction tuning improves
understanding and reasoning abilities. However, for tasks requiring factual
knowledge, generalist data containing hallucinatory information may negatively
affect the model's performance. Overall, our work provides a systematic guide

methodology, inspired by unCLIP, for instruction-tuning generative models of

Pretraining (VPT) model called STEVE-1, which can follow short-horizon
open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft. STEVE-1 is trained in two
steps: adapting the pretrained VPT model to follow commands in MineCLIP's
latent space, then training a prior to predict latent codes from text. This
allows us to finetune VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and
hindsight relabeling, reducing the need for costly human text annotations, and
all for only $60 of compute. By leveraging pretrained models like VPT and
MineCLIP and employing best practices from text-conditioned image generation,
STEVE-1 sets a new bar for open-ended instruction-following in Minecraft with
low-level controls (mouse and keyboard) and raw pixel inputs, far outperforming
previous baselines and robustly completing 12 of 13 tasks in our early-game

and performance degradation, or ""levelling down,"" where fairness is achieved by
making every group worse off, or by bringing better performing groups down to

everyone worse off in material or relational terms through injuries of stigma,

recent years. These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph
entities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning
versatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks.
However, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their

actually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and
relations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been
challenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs --
small, modified versions of a KG that leverage RDF/S information. The learnt
protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a KG, and
can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture semantics.

seriously impairs its generalization performance. Data augmentation, which is
effective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by
many previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial

augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in
adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data
augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general,
diversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost
robustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both

we adaptively discretize the action space for each sampled belief using a
hierarchical partition called Voronoi tree, which is a Binary Space
Partitioning that implicitly maintains the partition of a cell as the Voronoi
diagram of two points sampled from the cell. ADVT uses the estimated diameters
of the cells to form an upper-confidence bound on the action value function

discretization of the action space. This enables ADVT to better exploit local

identification of the most promising regions in the action space, compared to

the diameter of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many

developers or end-users. The recent advance of large language models (LLMs) in
language understanding and reasoning inspires us to rethink the problem from a
model-centric perspective, where task preparation, comprehension, and execution
are handled by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce AutoDroid,
a mobile task automation system capable of handling arbitrary tasks on any
Android application without manual efforts. The key insight is to combine the
commonsense knowledge of LLMs and domain-specific knowledge of apps through
automated dynamic analysis. The main components include a functionality-aware
UI representation method that bridges the UI with the LLM, exploration-based
memory injection techniques that augment the app-specific domain knowledge of
LLM, and a multi-granularity query optimization module that reduces the cost of
model inference. We integrate AutoDroid with off-the-shelf LLMs including
online GPT-4/GPT-3.5 and on-device Vicuna, and evaluate its performance on a
new benchmark for memory-augmented Android task automation with 158 common
tasks. The results demonstrated that AutoDroid is able to precisely generate
actions with an accuracy of 90.9%, and complete tasks with a success rate of
71.3%, outperforming the GPT-4-powered baselines by 36.4% and 39.7%. The demo,

challenging task, with existing metrics often relying on measuring the distance
between corresponding points that can be either inefficient or ineffective. In
this paper, we propose a novel distance metric called Calibrated Local Geometry
Distance (CLGD), which computes the difference between the underlying 3D
surfaces calibrated and induced by a set of reference points. By associating
each reference point with two given point clouds through computing its
directional distances to them, the difference in directional distances of an
identical reference point characterizes the geometric difference between a
typical local region of the two point clouds. Finally, CLGD is obtained by
averaging the directional distance differences of all reference points. We
evaluate CLGD on various optimization and unsupervised learning-based tasks,
including shape reconstruction, rigid registration, scene flow estimation, and
feature representation. Extensive experiments show that CLGD achieves
significantly higher accuracy under all tasks in a memory and computationally

annotated dataset. However, obtaining pixel-wise annotation is a
labor-intensive task that requires significant effort from domain experts,

The framework incorporates two training tasks: question-answer matching (QAM)

datasets identified by Bestvater and Monroe (2023), this study demonstrates
BERTopic's proficiency in extracting coherent topics and the effectiveness of

BERTopic improves coherence scores by 17.07% to 54.20% when compared to
traditional approaches such as Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF), prevalent in earlier political science research.
Additionally, our results indicate topic metrics outperform sentiment metrics

findings suggest topic metrics are especially effective for context-rich texts

non-convex loss landscapes. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a popular
solution that smooths the loss landscape by minimizing the maximized change of
training loss when adding a perturbation to the weight. However, indiscriminate
perturbation of SAM on all parameters is suboptimal and results in excessive
computation, double the overhead of common optimizers like Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD). In this paper, we propose Sparse SAM (SSAM), an efficient and

To obtain the sparse mask, we provide two solutions based on Fisher information

expectations in the next-generation mobile networks. Traditional methods cannot
perform efficient resource management since they tend to handle each
expectation independently. Existing approaches, e.g., based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) allocate resources in an efficient fashion when
there are conflicting expectations on the network slice. However, in reality,
systems are often far more complex to be addressed by a standalone MARL
formulation. Often there exists a hierarchical structure of intent fulfilment
where multiple pre-trained, self-interested agents may need to be further
orchestrated by a supervisor or controller agent. Such agents may arrive in the
system adhoc, which then needs to be orchestrated along with other available
agents. Retraining the whole system every time is often infeasible given the
associated time and cost. Given the challenges, such adhoc coordination of
pre-trained systems could be achieved through an intelligent supervisor agent
which incentivizes pre-trained RL/MARL agents through sets of dynamic contracts
(goals or bonuses) and encourages them to act as a cohesive unit towards
fulfilling a global expectation. Some approaches use a rule-based supervisor
agent and deploy the hierarchical constituent agents sequentially, based on
human-coded rules.
  In the current work, we propose a framework whereby pre-trained agents can be
orchestrated in parallel leveraging an AI-based supervisor agent. For this, we
propose to use Adhoc-Teaming approaches which assign optimal goals to the MARL
agents and incentivize them to exhibit certain desired behaviours. Results on

Game-testing AI agents that learn by interaction with the environment have the

framework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by
treating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes,
the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player
zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents
on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple
counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash
equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response
Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best
responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be
directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning
team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO
requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence,
which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel
algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both
frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter
population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious
self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter
policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions.
We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global

dramatically different, yet invariant representations to link them are
essential for many potential applications in robotics and augmented reality.
Prior work is limited to learning view-invariant features from paired
synchronized viewpoints. We relax that strong data assumption and propose to
learn fine-grained action features that are invariant to the viewpoints by
aligning egocentric and exocentric videos in time, even when not captured
simultaneously or in the same environment. To this end, we propose AE2, a
self-supervised embedding approach with two key designs: (1) an object-centric
encoder that explicitly focuses on regions corresponding to hands and active
objects; and (2) a contrastive-based alignment objective that leverages
temporally reversed frames as negative samples. For evaluation, we establish a
benchmark for fine-grained video understanding in the ego-exo context,
comprising four datasets -- including an ego tennis forehand dataset we
collected, along with dense per-frame labels we annotated for each dataset. On
the four datasets, our AE2 method strongly outperforms prior work in a variety
of fine-grained downstream tasks, both in regular and cross-view settings.",None,-1

large language models (LLMs) by employing a smaller draft model to predict the
target model's outputs. However, its efficacy can be limited due to the low

main idea is to continuously update the (multiple) draft model(s) on observed
user query data. Adapting to query distribution mitigates the shifts between
the training distribution of the draft model and the query distribution,
enabling the draft model to more accurately predict the target model's outputs.
We develop a prototype of online speculative decoding based on knowledge

single, global radiance field with finite representational capacity does not
scale to longer trajectories in an unbounded scene. For handling unknown poses,
we jointly estimate the camera poses with radiance field in a progressive
manner. We show that progressive optimization significantly improves the
robustness of the reconstruction. For handling large unbounded scenes, we
dynamically allocate new local radiance fields trained with frames within a
temporal window. This further improves robustness (e.g., performs well even

deep networks from sequential tasks. With impressive learning efficiency and
performance, prompt-based methods adopt a fixed backbone to sequential tasks by
learning task-specific prompts. However, existing prompt-based methods heavily

that their models could be trapped if the potential gap between the pretraining
task and unknown future tasks is large. In this work, we develop a learnable
Adaptive Prompt Generator (APG). The key is to unify the prompt retrieval and
prompt learning processes into a learnable prompt generator. Hence, the whole
prompting process can be optimized to reduce the negative effects of the gap
between tasks effectively. To make our APG avoid learning ineffective

issues in the traditional machine learning paradigm. While FL ensures that a
user's data always remain with the user, the gradients are shared with the

where the server can infer private information from the shared gradients. To
mitigate this flaw, the next-generation FL architectures proposed encryption

However, this approach creates other challenges, such as malicious users
sharing false gradients. Since the gradients are encrypted, the server is
unable to identify rogue users. To mitigate both attacks, this paper proposes a
novel FL algorithm based on a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme. We
develop a distributed multi-key additive homomorphic encryption scheme that

relying on human intervention, i.e., in a self-supervised fashion. In our
setting, an agent initially explores the environment using a pre-trained
off-the-shelf detector to locate objects and associate pseudo-labels. By
assuming that pseudo-labels for the same object must be consistent across
different views, we devise a novel mechanism for producing refined predictions
from the consensus among observations. Our approach improves the off-the-shelf
object detector by 2.66% in terms of mAP and outperforms the current state of
the art without relying on ground-truth annotations.",None,-1

whether LMs' words can refer, that is, achieve ""word-to-world"" connections.
There is prima facie reason to think they do not since LMs do not interact with
the world in the way that ordinary language users do. Drawing on insights from
the externalist tradition in philosophy of language, we argue that those

decoupled-guidance strategy, which uses different guidance strategies for the

prompt improves reconstruction ability, while an initialized unconditional
embedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the
attention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical

neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in photo-realistic novel view synthesis of

this work, we take a step back and reinvestigate how current implementations
may entail deleterious effects, including limited expressiveness, entanglement
of light and density fields, and sub-optimal motion localization. As a remedy,
we advocate for a bridge between classic non-rigid-structure-from-motion
(\nrsfm) and NeRF, enabling the well-studied priors of the former to constrain
the latter. To this end, we propose a framework that factorizes time and space
by formulating a scene as a composition of bandlimited, high-dimensional
signals. We demonstrate compelling results across complex dynamic scenes that

ubiquitous communication and computing infrastructure. In transportation

However, provisioning real-time and immersive services necessitates effective
physical-virtual synchronization between physical and virtual entities, i.e.,
AVs and Metaverse AR recommenders (MARs). In this paper, we propose a

Furthermore, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to match

hierarchical generalization: model depth plays greater role than model width.
We also find that pre-training on simpler language, such as child-directed

patterns from only a small number of examples, and to systematically generalize
those patterns to novel inputs. This capacity depends in large part on our
ability to represent complex visual inputs in terms of both objects and

capacity to extract object-centric representations, leading to the ability to
process multi-object visual inputs, but falling short of the systematic
generalization displayed by human reasoning. Other recent models have employed
inductive biases for relational abstraction to achieve systematic
generalization of learned abstract rules, but have generally assumed the
presence of object-focused inputs. Here, we combine these two approaches,
introducing Object-Centric Relational Abstraction (OCRA), a model that extracts
explicit representations of both objects and abstract relations, and achieves

interest (AOI) or regions of interest (ROI), respectively, to the eye tracking
data quality and classification task. The first approach uses feature
importance in a greedy way and grows or shrinks AOIs in all directions. The
second approach is an extension of the first approach, which divides the AOIs
into areas and calculates a direction of growth, i.e. a gradient. Both
approaches improve the classification results considerably in the case of
generalized AOIs, but can also be used for qualitative analysis. In qualitative
analysis, the algorithms presented allow the AOIs to be adapted to the data,
which means that errors and inaccuracies in eye tracking data can be better
compensated for. A good application example is abstract art, where manual AOIs
annotation is hardly possible, and data-driven approaches are mainly used for
initial AOIs.

qualitatively extract local and global explanations based on counterfactual
responses, which are ultimately proven insightful towards interpreting VQA

extent to which LLMs exhibit key social interaction principles, such as social
learning, social preference, and cooperative behavior (indirect reciprocity),
in their interactions with humans and other agents. We develop a framework for
our study, wherein classical laboratory experiments involving human subjects
are adapted to use LLM agents. This approach involves step-by-step reasoning
that mirrors human cognitive processes and zero-shot learning to assess the
innate preferences of LLMs. Our analysis of LLM agents' behavior includes both
the primary effects and an in-depth examination of the underlying mechanisms.
Focusing on GPT-4, our analyses suggest that LLM agents appear to exhibit a
range of human-like social behaviors such as distributional and reciprocity
preferences, responsiveness to group identity cues, engagement in indirect
reciprocity, and social learning capabilities. However, our analysis also
reveals notable differences: LLMs demonstrate a pronounced fairness preference,
weaker positive reciprocity, and a more calculating approach in social learning
compared to humans. These insights indicate that while LLMs hold great promise
for applications in social science research, such as in laboratory experiments

units are used to adaptively and iteratively fuse encoder and decoder features.
This not only improves the single-image depth inference but also does not
overspend model parameters. (2) Instead of using a single set of filters for
upsampling, multiple sets of filters are devised for the residual upsampling.
This facilitates the learning of edge-preserving filters and leads to the
improved performance. (3) A warping-based network is used to estimate a motion
field of moving objects without using semantic priors. This breaks down the
requirement of scene rigidity and allows to use general videos for the
unsupervised learning. The motion field is further regularized by an

belief-dependent constraint, before expanding a complete set of future

adaptive simplification technique for a probabilistically constrained setting.
Such an approach provably returns an identical-quality solution while
dramatically accelerating online decision making. Our universal framework
applies to any belief-dependent constrained continuous POMDP with parametric
beliefs, as well as nonparametric beliefs represented by particles. In the

popular tackers use Transformer attention to extract the template feature

understand the program quickly without having to read the code itself. Lately,
neural source code summarization has emerged as the frontier of research into
automated code summarization techniques. By far the most popular targets for
summarization are program subroutines. The idea, in a nutshell, is to train an
encoder-decoder neural architecture using large sets of examples of subroutines
extracted from code repositories. The encoder represents the code and the
decoder represents the summary. However, most current approaches attempt to
treat the subroutine as a single unit. For example, by taking the entire
subroutine as input to a Transformer or RNN-based encoder. But code behavior
tends to depend on the flow from statement to statement. Normally dynamic
analysis may shed light on this flow, but dynamic analysis on hundreds of
thousands of examples in large datasets is not practical. In this paper, we

bottom-up methods for learning implicit preferences from human behavior have
become increasingly popular, such as those for training and fine-tuning Large
Language Models. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing
approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modeled as a
continuum, and argue that the majority of popular techniques lie at the
extremes - either being fully hard-coded, or entirely learned, where no
explicit statement of any moral principle is required. Given the relative

learning from experience (i.e., Reinforcement Learning) to explicitly provide
moral principles to learning agents - either as intrinsic rewards, moral
logical constraints or textual principles for language models. For example,
using intrinsic rewards in Social Dilemma games, we demonstrate how it is
possible to represent classical moral frameworks for agents. We also present an

Furthermore, adaptability becomes paramount in non-stationary domains, where

existing CLIP-based systems lacks sensitivity to subtle differences in memes

MTL methods for RS (e.g. MMoE, PLE) focus on designing soft gating-based

their effectiveness and hindering the ability to generalize well on all tasks.
In this paper, we focus on the bottom representation learning of MTL in RS and

(AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) models. Despite their tremendous
success, a number of vital problems like ML model brittleness, their fairness,

in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and formal ML model verification.
The two major lines of work in XAI include feature selection methods, e.g.
Anchors, and feature attribution techniques, e.g. LIME and SHAP. Despite their
promise, most of the existing feature selection and attribution approaches are
susceptible to a range of critical issues, including explanation unsoundness
and out-of-distribution sampling. A recent formal approach to XAI (FXAI)
although serving as an alternative to the above and free of these issues
suffers from a few other limitations. For instance and besides the scalability
limitation, the formal approach is unable to tackle the feature attribution
problem. Additionally, a formal explanation despite being formally sound is
typically quite large, which hampers its applicability in practical settings.
Motivated by the above, this paper proposes a way to apply the apparatus of
formal XAI to the case of feature attribution based on formal explanation
enumeration. Formal feature attribution (FFA) is argued to be advantageous over

positions and at different temporal instances. The open-set nature of this
problem, occlusions/dis-occlusions due to the shift in viewpoint, and the lack
of suitable training datasets, presents substantial challenges in devising a
solution.
  To address this problem, we contribute a change detection model that is
trained entirely on synthetic data and is class-agnostic, yet it is performant
out-of-the-box on real world images without requiring fine-tuning. Our solution
entails a ""register and difference"" approach that leverages self-supervised
frozen embeddings and feature differences, which allows the model to generalise
to a wide variety of scenes and domains. The model is able to operate directly
on two RGB images, without requiring access to ground truth camera intrinsics,
extrinsics, depth maps, point clouds, or additional before-after images.
Finally, we collect and release a new evaluation dataset consisting of
real-world image pairs with human-annotated differences and demonstrate the
efficacy of our method. The code, datasets and pre-trained model can be found

sentences as close as possible to the original one, we propose Sequential
Integrated Gradients (SIG), which computes the importance of each word in a

In contrast, humans (and other animals) can learn useful multimodal

we evaluate the capabilities of a neural network architecture inspired by the
cognitive notion of a ""Global Workspace"": a shared representation for two (or
more) input modalities. Each modality is processed by a specialized system
(pretrained on unimodal data, and subsequently frozen). The corresponding
latent representations are then encoded to and decoded from a single shared
workspace. Importantly, this architecture is amenable to self-supervised
training via cycle-consistency: encoding-decoding sequences should approximate
the identity function. For various pairings of vision-language modalities and
across two datasets of varying complexity, we show that such an architecture
can be trained to align and translate between two modalities with very little
need for matched data (from 4 to 7 times less than a fully supervised

emergence of deep learning, but often require a huge amount of manually

ground-truth, we design an approach to break point clouds into raw fragments
and find the most confident samples for learning instance centroids.
Furthermore, we construct a recomposed dataset using pseudo instances, which is
used to learn our defined multilevel shape-aware objectness signal. An
asymmetrical object inference algorithm is followed to process core points and
boundary points with different strategies, and generate high-quality pseudo
instance labels to guide iterative training. Experiments demonstrate that our
method can achieve comparable results with recent fully supervised methods. By
generating pseudo instance labels from categorical semantic labels, our

relevant computations and determine the truth value of all relevant
logical/mathematical claims. This assumption is unrealistic when, for example,
we offer bets on remote digits of pi or when an agent faces a computationally
intractable planning problem. Furthermore, the assumption of logical
omniscience creates contradictions in cases where the environment can contain
descriptions of the agent itself. Importantly, strategic interactions as
studied in game theory are decision problems in which a rational agent is
predicted by its environment (the other players). In this paper, we develop a
theory of rational decision making that does not assume logical omniscience. We
consider agents who repeatedly face decision problems (including ones like
betting on digits of pi or games against other agents). The main contribution
of this paper is to provide a sensible theory of rationality for such agents.
Roughly, we require that a boundedly rational inductive agent tests each
efficiently computable hypothesis infinitely often and follows those hypotheses
that keep their promises of high rewards. We then prove that agents that are
rational in this sense have other desirable properties. For example, they learn
to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward. Finally,

the noise to noise mapping which can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single

is propaedeutic to XAI in three possible manners: exploiting concepts borrowed
from causality to support or improve XAI, utilizing counterfactuals for
explainability, and considering accessing a causal model as explaining itself.

Language Model (LLM) service paradigms. In cloud-based paradigms, users are
forced to compromise data locality for generation quality and processing speed.
Conversely, edge device paradigms maintain data locality but fail to deliver
satisfactory performance. In this work, we propose a novel LLM service paradigm
that distributes privacy-sensitive computation on edge devices and shared
computation in the cloud. Only activations are transmitted between the central
cloud and edge devices to ensure data locality. Our core innovation,
PrivateLoRA, addresses the challenging communication overhead by exploiting the
low rank of residual activations, achieving over 95% communication reduction.
Consequently, PrivateLoRA effectively maintains data locality and is extremely
resource efficient. Under standard 5G networks, PrivateLoRA achieves throughput
over 300% of device-only solutions for 7B models and over 80% of an A100 GPU
for 33B models. PrivateLoRA also provides tuning performance comparable to LoRA

domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, with larger models demonstrating more
pronounced effects. Furthermore, our results underscore the potential of

graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually highly inclined to majority classes

recently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to
balance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the
homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the
wide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly
aggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on
feature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to
imbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a
novel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and

synthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a
unified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and
existing nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to
adaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible
ranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs
different filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information

process, obtaining sub-optimal performance. Worse still, the conventional
static quality-consistent training setting, i.e., all data is assumed to be of
the same quality across training and inference, overlooks data quality changes
in real-world applications which may lead to poor robustness of the quantized
models. In this paper, we propose a novel Data Quality-aware Mixed-precision
Quantization framework, dubbed DQMQ, to dynamically adapt quantization
bit-widths to different data qualities. The adaption is based on a bit-width
decision policy that can be learned jointly with the quantization training.
Concretely, DQMQ is modeled as a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) task that
combines model-based policy optimization with supervised quantization training.
By relaxing the discrete bit-width sampling to a continuous probability
distribution that is encoded with few learnable parameters, DQMQ is
differentiable and can be directly optimized end-to-end with a hybrid
optimization target considering both task performance and quantization
benefits. Trained on mixed-quality image datasets, DQMQ can implicitly select
the most proper bit-width for each layer when facing uneven input qualities.
Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and networks demonstrate
the superiority of DQMQ against existing fixed/mixed-precision quantization

learning (ML) models on the one hand and a number of crucial issues pertaining

explainability question is: given this decision was made, what are the input
features which contributed to the decision? Although a range of XAI approaches
exist to tackle this problem, most of them have significant limitations.
Heuristic XAI approaches suffer from the lack of quality guarantees, and often
try to approximate Shapley values, which is not the same as explaining which
features contribute to a decision. A recent alternative is so-called formal
feature attribution (FFA), which defines feature importance as the fraction of
formal abductive explanations (AXp's) containing the given feature. This
measures feature importance from the view of formally reasoning about the
model's behavior. It is challenging to compute FFA using its definition because
that involves counting AXp's, although one can approximate it. Based on these
results, this paper makes several contributions. First, it gives compelling
evidence that computing FFA is intractable, even if the set of contrastive
formal explanations (CXp's) is provided, by proving that the problem is
#P-hard. Second, by using the duality between AXp's and CXp's, it proposes an
efficient heuristic to switch from CXp enumeration to AXp enumeration
on-the-fly resulting in an adaptive explanation enumeration algorithm

pretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT
pretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically
tailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of
exploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the
fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping
tokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping
and non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance
improvement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping
tokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a
very low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less
distinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping
tokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of
pre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that
these layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization
can benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate
pretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we
introduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the

model geospatial data is still underexplored. Urban flow, a typical kind of
geospatial data, is critical for a wide range of urban applications. Existing
studies mostly focus on predictive modeling of urban flow that predicts the
future flow based on historical flow data, which may be unavailable in
data-sparse areas or newly planned regions. Some other studies aim to predict
OD flow among regions but they fail to model dynamic changes of urban flow over
time. In this work, we study a new problem of urban flow generation that
generates dynamic urban flow for regions without historical flow data. To
capture the effect of multiple factors on urban flow, such as region features

regions under different conditions. We first construct an urban knowledge graph
(UKG) to model the urban environment and relationships between regions, based

generate urban flow for regions with different flow volumes, we design a novel
diffusion process guided by a volume estimator, which is learnable and
customized for each region. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-enhanced denoising

problem, we propose a Geo-Tokenizer, designed to efficiently reduce the number
of locations to be trained by representing a location as a combination of
several grids at different scales. In the Geo-Tokenizer, a grid at a larger
scale shares the common set of grids at smaller scales, which is a key factor
in reducing the size of the location vocabulary. The sequences of locations
preprocessed with the Geo-Tokenizer are utilized by a causal location embedding
model to capture the temporal dependencies of locations. This model dynamically
calculates the embedding vector of a target location, which varies depending on
its trajectory. In addition, to efficiently pre-train the location embedding
model, we propose the Hierarchical Auto-regressive Location Model objective to
effectively train decomposed locations in the Geo-Tokenizer. We conducted
experiments on two real-world user trajectory datasets using our pre-trained
location model. The experimental results show that our model significantly
improves the performance of downstream tasks with fewer model parameters

producing pseudo labels, which reduces the labeling bottleneck of language
model fine-tuning. Nevertheless, in facilitating semi-supervised controllable

self-generated pseudo text, generation models tend to over-exploit the
previously learned text distribution, suffering from mode collapse and poor
generation diversity. Second, generating pseudo text in each iteration is
time-consuming, severely decelerating the training process. In this work, we
propose KEST, a novel and efficient self-training framework to handle these

entropy, to learn from the soft pseudo text produced by a shared
non-autoregressive generator. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that KEST can benefit from more diverse pseudo text in an efficient manner,
which allows not only refining and exploiting the previously fitted
distribution but also enhanced exploration towards a larger potential text
space, providing a guarantee of improved performance. Experiments on three

as a multi-label classification problem, which greatly simplifies the learning
framework. Specifically, multiple binary pseudo-labels are assigned for each
input image by comparing its embeddings with those in two dictionaries, and the
network is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss. The proposed method
is named Multi-Label Self-supervised learning (MLS). Visualizations
qualitatively show that clearly the pseudo-labels by MLS can automatically find
semantically similar pseudo-positive pairs across different images to
facilitate contrastive learning. MLS learns high quality representations on

trajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third,
existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook the

single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative,
open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual
question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which
standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To
address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition

a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are
irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the
user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method

combination of rain streaks and raindrops, thereby increasing the challenges of
recovering the underlying clean image. Note that the rain streaks and raindrops
have diverse shapes, sizes, and locations in the captured image, and thus
modeling the correlation relationship between irregular degradations caused by
rain artifacts is a necessary prerequisite for image deraining. This paper aims
to present an efficient and flexible mechanism to learn and model degradation
relationships in a global view, thereby achieving a unified removal of
intricate rain scenes. To do so, we propose a Sparse Sampling Transformer based
on Uncertainty-Driven Ranking, dubbed UDR-S2Former. Compared to previous
methods, our UDR-S2Former has three merits. First, it can adaptively sample
relevant image degradation information to model underlying degradation
relationships. Second, explicit application of the uncertainty-driven ranking
strategy can facilitate the network to attend to degradation features and
understand the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results show that
our UDR-S2Former clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all

learning tasks. Typically, tabular data does not possess any machine-readable

Tab2KG - a novel method that targets at the interpretation of tables with
previously unseen data and automatically infers their semantics to transform
them into semantic data graphs. We introduce original lightweight semantic
profiles that enrich a domain ontology's concepts and relations and represent
domain and table characteristics. We propose a one-shot learning approach that
relies on these profiles to map a tabular dataset containing previously unseen
instances to a domain ontology. In contrast to the existing semantic table
interpretation approaches, Tab2KG relies on the semantic profiles only and does
not require any instance lookup. This property makes Tab2KG particularly
suitable in the data analytics context, in which data tables typically contain
new instances. Our experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets from
different application domains demonstrates that Tab2KG outperforms
state-of-the-art semantic table interpretation baselines.",None,-1

Generalized Advantage Estimation (UGAE), which allows for the computation of

UGAE with Beta-weighted discounting over the Monte Carlo baseline on standard

and their corresponding effects from an already trained model. It has
significant practical benefits, such as purging private, inaccurate, or
outdated information from trained models without the need for complete
re-training. Unlearning within a multimodal setting presents unique challenges
due to the intrinsic dependencies between different data modalities and the
expensive cost of training on large multimodal datasets and architectures.
Current approaches to machine unlearning have not fully addressed these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMUL, a machine unlearning
approach specifically designed for multimodal data and models. MMUL formulates
the multimodal unlearning task by focusing on three key properties: (a):
modality decoupling, which effectively decouples the association between
individual unimodal data points within multimodal inputs marked for deletion,
rendering them as unrelated data points within the model's context, (b):
unimodal knowledge retention, which retains the unimodal representation
capability of the model post-unlearning, and (c): multimodal knowledge
retention, which retains the multimodal representation capability of the model
post-unlearning. MMUL is efficient to train and is not constrained by the
requirement of using a strongly convex loss. Experiments on two multimodal
models and four multimodal benchmark datasets, including vision-language and
graph-language datasets, show that MMUL outperforms existing baselines, gaining
an average improvement of +17.6 points against the best-performing unimodal

MMUL can largely maintain pre-existing knowledge of the original model post

enhancing the local accuracy of the predicted result. However, the independent

guaranteeing fairness in the presence of uncertainty which is prevalent in many
socially sensitive applications, ranging from marketing analytics to actuarial
analysis and recidivism prediction instruments. To this end, we study a
longitudinal censored learning problem subject to fairness constraints, where
we require that algorithmic decisions made do not affect certain individuals or
social groups negatively in the presence of uncertainty on class label due to
censorship. We argue that this formulation has a broader applicability to
practical scenarios concerning fairness. We show how the newly devised fairness
notions involving censored information and the general framework for fair
predictions in the presence of censorship allow us to measure and mitigate
discrimination under uncertainty that bridges the gap with real-world
applications. Empirical evaluations on real-world discriminated datasets with
censorship demonstrate the practicality of our approach.",None,-1

heuristic policies, fitted using simulation optimization in JAX which allowed
the parallel evaluation of multiple candidate policy parameters on thousands of

alternative plans to the world model before selecting a final action to execute

necessary, for instance, to assess the performance of semantic graph parsing
systems. However, we observe some issues in the metric that jeopardize
meaningful evaluation. E.g., opaque pre-processing choices can affect results,
and current graph-alignment solvers do not provide us with upper-bounds.
Without upper-bounds, however, fair evaluation is not guaranteed. Furthermore,
adaptions of Smatch for extended tasks (e.g., fine-grained semantic similarity)
are spread out, and lack a unifying framework.
  For better inspection, we divide the metric into three modules:
pre-processing, alignment, and scoring. Examining each module, we specify its
goals and diagnose potential issues, for which we discuss and test mitigation
strategies. For pre-processing, we show how to fully conform to annotation
guidelines that allow structurally deviating but valid graphs. For safer and
enhanced alignment, we show the feasibility of optimal alignment in a standard
evaluation setup, and develop a lossless graph compression method that shrinks

detection. However, state-of-the-art approaches are usually trained on datasets
of smaller size or with a limited set of specific topics. As a consequence,
these models lack generalization capabilities and are not applicable to
real-world data. In this paper, we propose three models that adopt and
fine-tune state-of-the-art multimodal transformers for multimodal fake news
detection. We conduct an in-depth analysis by manipulating the input data aimed
to explore models performance in realistic use cases on social media. Our study
across multiple models demonstrates that these systems suffer significant
performance drops against manipulated data. To reduce the bias and improve
model generalization, we suggest training data augmentation to conduct more
meaningful experiments for fake news detection on social media. The proposed
data augmentation techniques enable models to generalize better and yield

convolutions, normalizations and non-linearities as well as downsampling
operations into potentially strong semantic embeddings. Yet, previous work

directly attributed to the networks' lack in robustness. To address such issues
and facilitate simpler and faster adversarial training, [12] recently proposed
FLC pooling, a method for provably alias-free downsampling - in theory. In this
work, we conduct a further analysis through the lens of signal processing and
find that such current pooling methods, which address aliasing in the frequency
domain, are still prone to spectral leakage artifacts. Hence, we propose
aliasing and spectral artifact-free pooling, short ASAP. While only introducing
a few modifications to FLC pooling, networks using ASAP as downsampling method
exhibit higher native robustness against common corruptions, a property that
FLC pooling was missing. ASAP also increases native robustness against
adversarial attacks on high and low resolution data while maintaining similar

significant challenges primarily attributed to the requirement of collecting
data from diverse domains. This task becomes particularly difficult due to
privacy restrictions and the scarcity of publicly available medical datasets.
Here, we propose Medical AGI (MedAGI), a paradigm to unify domain-specific

medical AGI. With an increasing number of domain-specific professional
multimodal LLMs in the medical field being developed, MedAGI is designed to
automatically select appropriate medical models by analyzing users' questions
with our novel adaptive expert selection algorithm. It offers a unified
approach to existing LLMs in the medical field, eliminating the need for
retraining regardless of the introduction of new models. This characteristic
renders it a future-proof solution in the dynamically advancing medical domain.
To showcase the resilience of MedAGI, we conducted an evaluation across three
distinct medical domains: dermatology diagnosis, X-ray diagnosis, and analysis
of pathology pictures. The results demonstrated that MedAGI exhibited
remarkable versatility and scalability, delivering exceptional performance

Attribute-consistent KGs (ACKGs) are first constructed via multi-modal

single-modal ones is relatively low, how to make a tradeoff between them is
difficult. In this work, we propose a universal cross-modality knowledge
distillation framework (UniDistill) to improve the performance of
single-modality detectors. Specifically, during training, UniDistill projects
the features of both the teacher and the student detector into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV), which is a friendly representation for different modalities. Then, three
distillation losses are calculated to sparsely align the foreground features,
helping the student learn from the teacher without introducing additional cost
during inference. Taking advantage of the similar detection paradigm of
different detectors in BEV, UniDistill easily supports LiDAR-to-camera,
camera-to-LiDAR, fusion-to-LiDAR and fusion-to-camera distillation paths.
Furthermore, the three distillation losses can filter the effect of misaligned
background information and balance between objects of different sizes,
improving the distillation effectiveness. Extensive experiments on nuScenes
demonstrate that UniDistill effectively improves the mAP and NDS of student
detectors by 2.0%~3.2%.",None,-1

resources, seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in
real-time communication with students. They often struggle to address the
diverse obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Solving
the problems encountered by students poses a significant challenge for
traditional deep learning models, as it requires not only a broad spectrum of
subject knowledge but also the ability to understand what constitutes a
student's individual difficulties. It's challenging for traditional machine
learning models, as they lack the capacity to comprehend students' personalized
needs. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the
possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests.
Although LLMs have been successful in various fields, creating an LLM-based
education system is still challenging for the wide range of educational skills
required. This paper reviews the recently emerged LLM research related to
educational capabilities, including mathematics, writing, programming,
reasoning, and knowledge-based question answering, with the aim to explore
their potential in constructing the next-generation intelligent education

aspects. Firstly, we examine the current state of LLMs regarding this
capability: how advanced they have become, whether they surpass human
abilities, and what deficiencies might exist. Secondly, we evaluate whether the
development methods for LLMs in this area are generalizable, that is, whether
these methods can be applied to construct a comprehensive educational

introduces the capability to seamlessly interact with tables, enabling a wide
range of functionalities such as question answering, data manipulation (e.g.,

LLMs on both table and text modalities, TableGPT achieves a deep understanding
of tabular data and the ability to perform complex operations on tables through
chain-of-command instructions. Importantly, TableGPT offers the advantage of

generating the subsequent token. However, we observed several shortcomings,
including performance degradation caused by a state copying mechanism or
numerous exit paths, and sensitivity to exit confidence thresholds.
Consequently, we propose a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework,

Our framework enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of
the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens. Furthermore, as
parallel decoding allows us to observe predictions from both shallow and deep

However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise.
Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also

We find that -- after finetuning them on data from psychological experiments --
these models offer accurate representations of human behavior, even
outperforming traditional cognitive models in two decision-making domains. In
addition, we show that their representations contain the information necessary
to model behavior on the level of individual subjects. Finally, we demonstrate
that finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict
human behavior in a previously unseen task. Taken together, these results
suggest that large, pre-trained models can be adapted to become generalist
cognitive models, thereby opening up new research directions that could
transform cognitive psychology and the behavioral sciences as a whole.",None,-1

offensive or harmful content in pretrained language models (PLMs) for safer
deployment. Existing methods can be roughly categorized as finetuning-based and
decoding-based. However, the former is often resource-intensive, while the
latter relies on additional components and potentially compromises the
generation fluency. In this paper, we propose a more lightweight approach that
enables the PLM itself to achieve ""self-detoxification"". Our method is built
upon the observation that prepending a negative steering prompt can effectively
induce PLMs to generate toxic content. At the same time, we are inspired by the
recent research in the interpretability field, which formulates the evolving
contextualized representations within the PLM as an information stream
facilitated by the attention layers. Drawing on this idea, we devise a method
to identify the toxification direction from the normal generation process to
the one prompted with the negative prefix, and then steer the generation to the
reversed direction by manipulating the information movement within the
attention layers. Experimental results show that our approach, without any
fine-tuning or extra components, can achieve comparable performance with

heterogeneity including differences in causes, neuroimaging characteristics,

deviations relating to disease pathology. For many heterogeneous diseases, we
expect to observe abnormalities across a range of neuroimaging and biological
variables. However, thus far, normative models have largely been developed for
studying a single imaging modality. We aim to develop a multi-modal normative
modelling framework where abnormality is aggregated across variables of
multiple modalities and is better able to detect deviations than uni-modal
baselines. We propose two multi-modal VAE normative models to detect subject
level deviations across T1 and DTI data. Our proposed models were better able
to detect diseased individuals, capture disease severity, and correlate with
patient cognition than baseline approaches. We also propose a multivariate

promise of interpretability, systematic evaluations were never performed to
assess the interpretability of these policies, likely because of the complexity
of such an evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric that uses
large-language models (LLM) to assess the interpretability of programmatic
policies. For our metric, an LLM is given both a program and a description of
its associated programming language. The LLM then formulates a natural language
explanation of the program. This explanation is subsequently fed into a second
LLM, which tries to reconstruct the program from the natural-language
explanation. Our metric then measures the behavioral similarity between the
reconstructed program and the original. We validate our approach with
synthesized and human-crafted programmatic policies for playing a real-time
strategy game, comparing the interpretability scores of these programmatic
policies to obfuscated versions of the same programs. Our LLM-based
interpretability score consistently ranks less interpretable programs lower and
more interpretable ones higher. These findings suggest that our metric could
serve as a reliable and inexpensive tool for evaluating the interpretability of
programmatic policies.",None,-1

exploring their logged practice quiz data. It plays a pivotal role in
personalized learning guidance within intelligent education systems. In this
paper, we focus on an important, practical, yet often underexplored task:
domain-level zero-shot cognitive diagnosis (DZCD), which arises due to the
absence of student practice logs in newly launched domains. Recent cross-domain
diagnostic models have been demonstrated to be a promising strategy for DZCD.
These methods primarily focus on how to transfer student states across domains.
However, they might inadvertently incorporate non-transferable information into
student representations, thereby limiting the efficacy of knowledge transfer.
To tackle this, we propose Zero-1-to-3, a domain-level zero-shot cognitive
diagnosis framework via one batch of early-bird students towards three
diagnostic objectives. Our approach initiates with pre-training a diagnosis
model with dual regularizers, which decouples student states into domain-shared
and domain-specific parts. The shared cognitive signals can be transferred to
the target domain, enriching the cognitive priors for the new domain, which
ensures the cognitive state propagation objective. Subsequently, we devise a
strategy to generate simulated practice logs for cold-start students through
analyzing the behavioral patterns from early-bird students, fulfilling the
domain-adaption goal. Consequently, we refine the cognitive states of
cold-start students as diagnostic outcomes via virtual data, aligning with the
diagnosis-oriented goal. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world

involves synthesizing new views of a scene from a limited set of input images.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful approach to address
this problem, but they require accurate knowledge of camera \textit{intrinsic}
and \textit{extrinsic} parameters. Traditionally, structure-from-motion (SfM)
and multi-view stereo (MVS) approaches have been used to extract camera
parameters, but these methods can be unreliable and may fail in certain cases.
In this paper, we propose a novel technique that leverages unposed images from
dynamic datasets, such as the NVIDIA dynamic scenes dataset, to learn camera
parameters directly from data. Our approach is highly extensible and can be
integrated into existing NeRF architectures with minimal modifications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of static and dynamic
scenes and show that it outperforms traditional SfM and MVS approaches. The

proving still remains one of the hardest reasoning tasks that is far from being
fully solved. Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising
results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems.
One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem
library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know,
creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but
crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper
results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill
library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs
used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover
enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to
create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved
(by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and
reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling
increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library
further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it
easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass
rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%).
During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000
skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation
study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving
theorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%. We

environments where the full state cannot be perceived by an agent. As such the
agent needs to reason taking into account the past observations and actions.
However, simply remembering the full history is generally intractable due to
the exponential growth in the history space. Maintaining a probability
distribution that models the belief over what the true state is can be used as
a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to
the model of the environment and is often intractable. While SOTA algorithms
use Recurrent Neural Networks to compress the observation-action history aiming
to learn a sufficient statistic, they lack guarantees of success and can lead
to sub-optimal policies. To overcome this, we propose the Wasserstein Belief

they would directly. We investigate why and how chain-of-thought reasoning is
useful in language models, testing the hypothesis that reasoning is effective
when training data consists of overlapping local clusters of variables that
influence each other strongly. These training conditions enable the chaining of
accurate local inferences to estimate relationships between variables that were
not seen together in training. We prove that there will exist a ""reasoning

simple case of an autoregressive density estimator trained on local samples

probabilities with and without intermediate reasoning steps, finding that
intermediate steps are only helpful when the training data is locally

policy chooses a small subset of nodes (up to 200 in our experiment) from all
nodes that are to be traversed, while the lower-level policy takes the chosen
nodes as input and outputs a tour connecting them to the existing partial route
(initially only containing the depot). After jointly training the upper-level

mapping between the corresponding function spaces. From the perspective of
approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional
latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and
then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel
integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to
generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key
characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the
kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type
attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and
therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention
architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for
SR problems to ""hallucinate"" high-frequency information from the LR image.

focused on how explanations can improve human-plus-AI task performance as

impact of explanations on different user groups across many metrics (mental
discomfort, stereotype activation, and perceived workload). We apply this
method in the context of content moderation of potential hate speech, and its
differential impact on Asian vs. non-Asian proxy moderators, across explanation
approaches (saliency map and counterfactual explanation). We find that saliency

one of the pseudo-modalities as the meta-train dataset, and perform
meta-testing on a continuous augmented image space generated through Dirichlet
mixup of the remaining pseudo-modalities. Further, we introduce two loss

speech being indistinguishable from real speech. However, efficient and

\times P$ matrix can be performed using fewer multiplications than what the
naive $NMP$ approach suggests. The most famous instance of this is Strassen's
algorithm for multiplying two $2\times 2$ matrices in 7 instead of 8
multiplications. This gives rise to the constraint satisfaction problem of fast
matrix multiplication, where a set of $R < NMP$ multiplication terms must be
chosen and combined such that they satisfy correctness constraints on the
output matrix. Despite its highly combinatorial nature, this problem has not
been exhaustively examined from that perspective, as evidenced for example by
the recent deep reinforcement learning approach of AlphaTensor. In this work,
we propose a simple yet novel Constraint Programming approach to find
non-commutative algorithms for fast matrix multiplication or provide proof of
infeasibility otherwise. We propose a set of symmetry-breaking constraints and
valid inequalities that are particularly helpful in proving infeasibility. On
the feasible side, we find that exploiting solver performance variability in
conjunction with a sparsity-based problem decomposition enables finding
solutions for larger (feasible) instances of fast matrix multiplication. Our
experimental results using CP Optimizer demonstrate that we can find fast
matrix multiplication algorithms for matrices up to $3\times 3$ in a short

encoding the model's hidden states to a message and (2) a decoder decoding any
messages to its own hidden states. With encoder and decoder, not only can the
teacher transfer rich information by encoding its hidden states, but also the
student can send messages with information of downstream tasks to the teacher.
Therefore, knowledge passing from teacher to student can be tailored to the
student's capacity and downstream tasks' distributions. We conducted

odometry mostly relies on geometric features such as points, lines and planes.
A lack of these features in the environment can lead to the failure of the
entire odometry system. To avoid this problem, we extract feature points from
the LiDAR-generated point cloud that match features identified in LiDAR
intensity images. We then use the extracted feature points to perform scan
registration and estimate the robot ego-movement. For the back-end, we jointly
optimize the distance between the corresponding feature points, and the point
to plane distance for planes identified in the map. In addition, we use the
features extracted from intensity images to detect loop closure candidates from
previous scans and perform pose graph optimization. Our experiments show that
our method can run in real time with high accuracy and works well with
illumination changes, low-texture, and unstructured environments.",None,-1

physiological measurements of Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, (2)
common thorax diseases pre-defined by radiologists, (3) BERT-based text

demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines,
validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task,

wearable-camera videos that span hours or even days. We propose SpotEM, an
approach to achieve efficiency for a given EM method while maintaining good
accuracy. SpotEM consists of three key ideas: 1) a novel clip selector that
learns to identify promising video regions to search conditioned on the
language query; 2) a set of low-cost semantic indexing features that capture
the context of rooms, objects, and interactions that suggest where to look; and
3) distillation losses that address the optimization issues arising from
end-to-end joint training of the clip selector and EM model. Our experiments on
200+ hours of video from the Ego4D EM Natural Language Queries benchmark and
three different EM models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:
computing only 10% - 25% of the clip features, we preserve 84% - 97% of the
original EM model's accuracy. Project page:

effective visual representations can be learned from unlabeled images. This has
led to increased interest in applying self-supervised learning to the medical
domain, where unlabeled images are abundant and labeled images are difficult to
obtain. However, most self-supervised learning approaches are modeled as image
level discriminative or generative proxy tasks, which may not capture the finer
level representations necessary for dense prediction tasks like multi-organ
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework
that integrates Localized Region Contrast (LRC) to enhance existing
self-supervised pre-training methods for medical image segmentation. Our
approach involves identifying Super-pixels by Felzenszwalb's algorithm and
performing local contrastive learning using a novel contrastive sampling loss.
Through extensive experiments on three multi-organ segmentation datasets, we
demonstrate that integrating LRC to an existing self-supervised method in a
limited annotation setting significantly improves segmentation performance.
Moreover, we show that LRC can also be applied to fully-supervised pre-training
methods to further boost performance.",None,-1

artificial intelligence by demonstrating their ability in generating human-like

LLMs lack recent information and often employ imprecise language, which can be

this study, we make use of recent ideas to harness the potential of LLMs by
viewing them as agents that access multiple sources, including databases
containing recent and precise information about organizations, institutions,

prototype agent that retrieves emission data from ClimateWatch

integrating these resources with LLMs, our approach overcomes the limitations
associated with imprecise language and delivers more reliable and accurate

translation between two languages, the source corpus is often used as the
target corpus, which involves the training of two models with opposite
directions. The question of which one can adapt most quickly to a domain shift

distribution p that changes due to an unknown intervention, resulting in a
modified distribution p*. In aligning p with p*, several factors can affect the
adaptation rate, including the causal dependencies between variables in p. In
real-life scenarios, however, we have to consider the fairness of the training
process, and it is particularly crucial to involve a sensitive variable (bias)
present between a cause and an effect variable. To explore this scenario, we
examine a simple structural causal model (SCM) with a cause-bias-effect

effect (Y). The two models, respectively, exhibit consistent and contrary
cause-effect directions in the cause-bias-effect SCM. After conducting unknown

information we observe. Previous work by Bolander et al. (2016) proposes a
model of attention based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) where agents are
either fully attentive or not attentive at all. While introducing the realistic
feature that inattentive agents believe nothing happens, the model does not
represent the most essential aspect of attention: its selectivity. Here, we
propose a generalization that allows for paying attention to subsets of atomic
formulas. We introduce the corresponding logic for propositional attention, and
show its axiomatization to be sound and complete. We then extend the framework
to account for inattentive agents that, instead of assuming nothing happens,
may default to a specific truth-value of what they failed to attend to (a sort
of prior concerning the unattended atoms). This feature allows for a more
cognitively plausible representation of the inattentional blindness phenomenon,
where agents end up with false beliefs due to their failure to attend to
conspicuous but unexpected events. Both versions of the model define
attention-based learning through appropriate DEL event models based on a few
and clear edge principles. While the size of such event models grow
exponentially both with the number of agents and the number of atoms, we
introduce a new logical language for describing event models syntactically and
show that using this language our event models can be represented linearly in

interpretability of the automated scores. Furthermore, they can be used to

Traditional methods rely on human annotations or, more recently, a set of class
seed words for supervision, which can be costly, particularly for specialized
or emerging domains. To address this, using class surface names alone as
extremely weak supervision has been proposed. However, existing approaches
treat different levels of text granularity (documents, sentences, or words)
independently, disregarding inter-granularity class disagreements and the
context identifiable exclusively through joint extraction. In order to tackle
these issues, we introduce MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text
classification method that leverages Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities.
MEGClass utilizes coarse- and fine-grained context signals obtained by jointly
considering a document's most class-indicative words and sentences. This
approach enables the learning of a contextualized document representation that
captures the most discriminative class indicators. By preserving the
heterogeneity of potential classes, MEGClass can select the most informative
class-indicative documents as iterative feedback to enhance the initial
word-based class representations and ultimately fine-tune a pre-trained text
classifier. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods.",None,-1

profession names (e.g., Spanish ""doctora"" for ""female doctor"") tend to be split
into multiple subword tokens. Our results indicate that the imbalance of gender
forms in the model's training corpus is a major factor contributing to gender
bias and has a greater impact than subword splitting. We show that analyzing
subword splits provides good estimates of gender-form imbalance in the training

been effectively addressed by existing scale-aware algorithms. An important
factor is that they typically involve cooperative learning across

STEERER are a dedicated Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA), which
selectively forwards scale-customized features at each scale, and a Masked
Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) that helps to achieve high-quality

head motion behaviour has not received much attention as a biomarker. This
study demonstrates the utility of fundamental head-motion units, termed

learning kineme patterns only from healthy controls, and computing statistics
derived from reconstruction errors for both the patient and control classes.
Employing machine learning methods, we evaluate depression classification

restoring, compensating or adjusting. In the clinical assessment of orofacial
structures and functions, at rest condition or during speech and non-speech
movements, a qualitative evaluation is usually performed, throughout visual
observation. Methods: To overcome limitations posed by qualitative assessments,
this work presents a store-and-forward self-service telemonitoring system that

becomes a popular research topic in recent years. To alleviate the scalability
issue of completely centralized RL techniques and the non-stationarity issue of
completely decentralized RL techniques on large-scale traffic networks, some
literature utilizes a regional control approach where the whole network is
firstly partitioned into multiple disjoint regions, followed by applying the
centralized RL approach to each region. However, the existing partitioning
rules either have no constraints on the topology of regions or require the same
topology for all regions. Meanwhile, no existing regional control approach
explores the performance of optimal joint action in an exponentially growing
regional action space when intersections are controlled by 4-phase traffic
signals (EW, EWL, NS, NSL). In this paper, we propose a novel RL training
framework named RegionLight to tackle the above limitations. Specifically, the
topology of regions is firstly constrained to a star network which comprises
one center and an arbitrary number of leaves. Next, the network partitioning
problem is modeled as an optimization problem to minimize the number of
regions. Then, an Adaptive Branching Dueling Q-Network (ABDQ) model is proposed
to decompose the regional control task into several joint signal control
sub-tasks corresponding to particular intersections. Subsequently, these
sub-tasks maximize the regional benefits cooperatively. Finally, the global

as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide
training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on
decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE
makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to
adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized
training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize
global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy
exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent
reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange
among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for
execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to
seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To
further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning
mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one
without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on
StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared
with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly

viable in later rounds; otherwise, the arm departs and is no longer available.
The system aims to maximize the users' (content consumers) welfare. To that

mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as

public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to
encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing
methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling
data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public

Reasoning is accomplished with a modal Horn-clause meta-interpreter that

style model. To preserve the multimodal style information, MODIFY further
introduces an additional remapping network, mapping a known continuous
distribution into the encoder's embedding space. During translation in the
source domain, MODIFY fine-tunes the encoder module within the target
style-persevering model to capture the content of the source input as precisely
as possible. Our method is extremely simple and satisfies versatile training

asymmetric pooling on the spectral-spatial dimension maximally retains the
essential features of HSI. Then, the 3D convolution with a selectable range of
receptive fields overcomes the constraints of fixed-sized convolution kernels.
Finally, we extend these two searchable operations to different layers of each
stage to build the final architecture. Extensive experiments are conducted on
two challenging HSI benchmarks including Indian Pines and Houston University,
and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with superior
performance compared with the related works.",None,-1

3466533f-b06a-4218-bcdc-9e5982b57778,Adversarial Alignment for Source Free Object Detection,0.601669,"Source-free object detection (SFOD) aims to transfer a detector pre-trained
on a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain without seeing
source data. While most existing SFOD methods generate pseudo labels via a
source-pretrained model to guide training, these pseudo labels usually contain
high noises due to heavy domain discrepancy. In order to obtain better pseudo
supervisions, we divide the target domain into source-similar and
source-dissimilar parts and align them in the feature space by adversarial
learning. Specifically, we design a detection variance-based criterion to
divide the target domain. This criterion is motivated by a finding that larger
detection variances denote higher recall and larger similarity to the source
domain. Then we incorporate an adversarial module into a mean teacher framework
to drive the feature spaces of these two subsets indistinguishable. Extensive
experiments on multiple cross-domain object detection datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method consistently outperforms the compared SFOD methods.",None,-1

Question Answering (VQA) models, namely ViLBERT, ViLT, and LXMERT, in the
context of answering questions relating to driving scenarios. The performance
of these models is evaluated by comparing the similarity of responses to
reference answers provided by computer vision experts. Model selection is
predicated on the analysis of transformer utilization in multimodal
architectures. The results indicate that models incorporating cross-modal
attention and late fusion techniques exhibit promising potential for generating
improved answers within a driving perspective. This initial analysis serves as
a launchpad for a forthcoming comprehensive comparative study involving nine
VQA models and sets the scene for further investigations into the effectiveness
of VQA model queries in self-driving scenarios. Supplementary material is

to role-play a fictional character and interact with other characters in
narratives such as novels in an immersive environment. We leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses, guided by personality
traits extracted from narratives. The system incorporates auto-generated visual
display of narrative settings, character portraits, and character speech,
greatly enhancing user experience. Our approach eschews predefined sandboxes,
focusing instead on main storyline events extracted from narratives from the
perspective of a user-selected character. NarrativePlay has been evaluated on
two types of narratives, detective and adventure stories, where users can
either explore the world or improve their favorability with the narrative
characters through conversations.",None,-1

image analysis tasks. A promising paradigm for achieving anatomically
consistent segmentation via deep networks is incorporating pixel connectivity,
a basic concept in digital topology, to model inter-pixel relationships.
However, previous works on connectivity modeling have ignored the rich
channel-wise directional information in the latent space. In this work, we
demonstrate that effective disentanglement of directional sub-space from the
shared latent space can significantly enhance the feature representation in the
connectivity-based network. To this end, we propose a directional connectivity
modeling scheme for segmentation that decouples, tracks, and utilizes the
directional information across the network. Experiments on various public
medical image segmentation benchmarks show the effectiveness of our model as
compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

have recently enabled 3D content creation by optimizing a randomly initialized
differentiable 3D representation with score distillation. However, the
optimization process suffers slow convergence and the resultant 3D models often
exhibit two limitations: (a) quality concerns such as missing attributes and
distorted shape and texture; (b) extremely low diversity comparing to
text-guided image synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conflict between
the 3D optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillation
is the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, we propose
to prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions,
which aligns the 3D optimization process with the sampling process of diffusion
model. Extensive experiments show that our simple redesign significantly
improves 3D content creation with faster convergence, better quality and
diversity.",None,-1
