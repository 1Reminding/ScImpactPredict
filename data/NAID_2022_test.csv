the real-life experience of Amazon drivers into the solution of optimal route
planning and optimization. This paper presents our method that tackles this
challenge by hierarchically combining machine learning and conventional
Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) solvers. Our method reaps the benefits from
both worlds. On the one hand, our method encodes driver know-how by learning a
sequential probability model from historical routes at the zone level, where
each zone contains a few parcel stops. It then uses a single step policy
iteration method, known as the Rollout algorithm, to generate plausible zone
sequences sampled from the learned probability model. On the other hand, our
method utilizes proven methods developed in the rich TSP literature to sequence
stops within each zone efficiently. The outcome of such a combination appeared
to be promising. Our method obtained an evaluation score of $0.0374$, which is
comparable to what the top three teams have achieved on the official Challenge

routes that may exhibit distinct sequential patterns beyond the scope of this

attention mechanisms. However, they ignore the frequency bias of GANs and take
poor consideration towards frequency information, especially high-frequency
signals that contain rich details. To fully utilize the frequency information
of limited data, this paper proposes FreGAN, which raises the model's frequency
awareness and draws more attention to producing high-frequency signals,
facilitating high-quality generation. In addition to exploiting both real and
generated images' frequency information, we also involve the frequency signals
of real images as a self-supervised constraint, which alleviates the GAN
disequilibrium and encourages the generator to synthesize adequate rather than
arbitrary frequency signals. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority and
effectiveness of our FreGAN in ameliorating generation quality in the low-data
regime (especially when training data is less than 100). Besides, FreGAN can be
seamlessly applied to existing regularization and attention mechanism models to
further boost the performance.",https://github.com/kobeshegu/FreGAN_NeurIPS2022,-1

Instead, out-of-sample error is better described through a generalization
bound. In this context, we explore the connections between the ELBO objective
from variational inference and the PAC-Bayes objectives. We note that, while
the ELBO and PAC-Bayes objectives are similar, the latter objectives naturally
contain a temperature parameter $\lambda$ which is not restricted to be
$\lambda=1$. For both regression and classification tasks, in the case of
isotropic Laplace approximations to the posterior, we show how this

of the discharge summary generation: whole sentences, clinical segments, and
clauses. We defined clinical segments in this study, aiming to express the
smallest medically meaningful concepts. To obtain the clinical segments, it was
necessary to automatically split the texts in the first stage of the pipeline.
Accordingly, we compared rule-based methods and a machine learning method, and
the latter outperformed the formers with an F1 score of 0.846 in the splitting

imbalanced attention to training samples, where recently exposed samples

fuzzy sets (C-IFSs) proposed by Atannassov and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs)
proposed by Yager. A circular Pythagorean fuzzy set is represented by a circle
that represents the membership degree and the non-membership degree and whose
center consists of non-negative real numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$ with the condition
$\mu^2+\nu^2\leq 1$. A C-PFS models the fuzziness of the uncertain information
more properly thanks to its structure that allows modelling the information
with points of a circle of a certain center and a radius. Therefore, a C-PFS
lets decision makers to evaluate objects in a larger and more flexible region
and thus more sensitive decisions can be made. After defining the concept of
C-PFS we define some fundamental set operations between C-PFSs and propose some
algebraic operations between C-PFVs via general $t$-norms and $t$-conorms. By
utilizing these algebraic operations, we introduce some weighted aggregation
operators to transform input values represented by C-PFVs to a single output
value. Then to determine the degree of similarity between C-PFVs we define a
cosine similarity measure based on radius. Furthermore, we develop a method to
transform a collection of Pythagorean fuzzy values to a PFS. Finally, a method
is given to solve multi-criteria decision making problems in circular
Pythagorean fuzzy environment and the proposed method is practiced to a problem
about selecting the best photovoltaic cell from the literature. We also study
the comparison analysis and time complexity of the proposed method.",None,-1

segmentation task. The goal of the task is to temporally detect and segment
actions in long, untrimmed procedural videos, where only a small set of videos

end, we propose two novel loss functions for the unlabelled data: an action
affinity loss and an action continuity loss. The action affinity loss guides
the unlabelled samples learning by imposing the action priors induced from the
labelled set. Action continuity loss enforces the temporal continuity of
actions, which also provides frame-wise classification supervision. In
addition, we propose an Adaptive Boundary Smoothing (ABS) approach to build
coarser action boundaries for more robust and reliable learning. The proposed
loss functions and ABS were evaluated on three benchmarks. Results show that

Transformer architectures have achieved impressive results in tasks such as
optical flow and depth estimation by encoding geometric priors as inputs rather
than as enforced constraints. In this paper, we extend this idea and propose to
learn an implicit, multi-view consistent scene representation, introducing a
series of 3D data augmentation techniques as a geometric inductive prior to
increase view diversity. We also show that introducing view synthesis as an
auxiliary task further improves depth estimation. Our Depth Field Networks

respond to trip requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard
combinatorial and sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. To
avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term,
vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility
function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility
function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be
performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when
applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch
paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the
environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g.,
traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become
stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve
the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic
trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by
construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our
problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP
as a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate
actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while
optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging;
indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice.
To tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to

traces. Thus, this paper proposes a novel screen-shooting resilient
watermarking scheme for document image using deep neural network. By applying
this scheme, when the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and captured
by a camera, the watermark can be still extracted from the captured
photographs. Specifically, our scheme is an end-to-end neural network with an
encoder to embed watermark and a decoder to extract watermark. During the
training process, a distortion layer between encoder and decoder is added to
simulate the distortions introduced by screen-shooting process in real scenes,
such as camera distortion, shooting distortion, light source distortion.
Besides, an embedding strength adjustment strategy is designed to improve the
visual quality of the watermarked image with little loss of extraction
accuracy. The experimental results show that the scheme has higher robustness
and visual quality than other three recent state-of-the-arts. Specially, even
if the shooting distances and angles are in extreme, our scheme can also obtain
high extraction accuracy.",https://github.com/gslxr/Screen-Shooting-Resilient-Document-Image-Watermarking,-1

formalisms pose highly demanding annotation tasks involving large taxonomies of

each sentence as an answer to a question triggered in prior context; thus, we
characterize relationships between sentences as free-form questions, in
contrast to exhaustive fine-grained taxonomies. We develop the
first-of-its-kind QUD parser that derives a dependency structure of questions
over full documents, trained using a large, crowdsourced question-answering
dataset DCQA (Ko et al., 2022). Human evaluation results show that QUD
dependency parsing is possible for language models trained with this
crowdsourced, generalizable annotation scheme. We illustrate how our QUD

operator receives recommendations from an algorithm but is the ultimate
decision maker. Hence, the algorithm's recommendation may differ from the

recommendations will be perfectly implemented. We propose an adherence-aware
optimization framework to capture the dichotomy between the recommended and the
implemented policy and analyze the impact of partial adherence on the optimal
recommendation. We show that overlooking the partial adherence phenomenon, as
is currently being done by most recommendation engines, can lead to arbitrarily
severe performance deterioration, compared with both the current human baseline
performance and what is expected by the recommendation algorithm. Our framework
also provides useful tools to analyze the structure and to compute optimal
recommendation policies that are naturally immune against such human

multi-modal sensors can collect different modal data, so the use of multi-modal

charger, or use a multi-step approach (e.g., a first high level aggregate
control decision step, followed by individual EV control decisions), we rather
propose a single-step solution that jointly coordinates multiple charging

knowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human
is unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to
intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing
a detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be
tempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user. However, in most

challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack

opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner
workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.
  Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges

models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive
framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation
practices and metrics are proposed. Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in
the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as
well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can
either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained
models in a post-hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose
the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word
embeddings (input-level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing-level)
and (3) models' decisions (output-level). We also detail the different

trained classifiers, ignoring the impact of the interaction between object and
state; the other methods try to learn the joint representation of the
state-object compositions, leading to the domain gap between seen and unseen
composition sets. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Contrastive
Embedding Network (SCEN) (Code: https://github.com/XDUxyLi/SCEN-master) for
unseen composition recognition. Considering the entanglement between state and
object, we embed the visual feature into a Siamese Contrastive Space to capture
prototypes of them separately, alleviating the interaction between state and
object. In addition, we design a State Transition Module (STM) to increase the
diversity of training compositions, improving the robustness of the recognition
model. Extensive experiments indicate that our method significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches on three challenging benchmark datasets,
including the recent proposed C-QGA dataset.",https://github.com/XDUxyLi/SCEN-master,-1
4bbe4736-9fde-4716-9b98-6d113afe54c3,Aggregate effects of advertising decisions: a complex systems look at search engine advertising via an experimental study,0.449051,"Purpose: We model group advertising decisions, which are the collective
decisions of every single advertiser within the set of advertisers who are
competing in the same auction or vertical industry, and examine resulting
market outcomes, via a proposed simulation framework named EXP-SEA
(Experimental Platform for Search Engine Advertising) supporting experimental
studies of collective behaviors in the context of search engine advertising.
Design: We implement the EXP-SEA to validate the proposed simulation framework,
also conduct three experimental studies on the aggregate impact of electronic
word-of-mouth, the competition level, and strategic bidding behaviors. EXP-SEA
supports heterogeneous participants, various auction mechanisms, and also
ranking and pricing algorithms. Findings: Findings from our three experiments
show that (a) both the market profit and advertising indexes such as number of
impressions and number of clicks are larger when the eWOM effect presents,
meaning social media certainly has some effect on search engine advertising
outcomes, (b) the competition level has a monotonic increasing effect on the
market performance, thus search engines have an incentive to encourage both the
eWOM among search users and competition among advertisers, and (c) given the
market-level effect of the percentage of advertisers employing a dynamic greedy
bidding strategy, there is a cut-off point for strategic bidding behaviors.
Originality: This is one of the first research works to explore collective
group decisions and resulting phenomena in the complex context of search engine
advertising via developing and validating a simulation framework that supports
assessments of various advertising strategies and estimations of the impact of
mechanisms on the search market.",None,-1

promising way to address poor sample efficiency in autonomous behavior
acquisition, methods that do so typically assume that the requisite behavior
demonstrations are provided by an expert that behaves optimally with respect to
a task reward. If, however, suboptimal demonstrations are provided, a
fundamental challenge appears in that the demonstration-matching objective of
IL conflicts with the return-maximization objective of RL. This paper
introduces D-Shape, a new method for combining IL and RL that uses ideas from
reward shaping and goal-conditioned RL to resolve the above conflict. D-Shape
allows learning from suboptimal demonstrations while retaining the ability to
find the optimal policy with respect to the task reward. We experimentally
validate D-Shape in sparse-reward gridworld domains, showing that it both
improves over RL in terms of sample efficiency and converges consistently to
the optimal policy in the presence of suboptimal demonstrations.",None,-1

such as Virtual Reality, Autonomous Driving, Robotics, etc. In this paper, we
propose a novel, model-agnostic, two-stage pipeline for omnidirectional
monocular depth estimation. Our proposed framework PanoDepth takes one 360
image as input, produces one or more synthesized views in the first stage, and
feeds the original image and the synthesized images into the subsequent stereo
matching stage. In the second stage, we propose a differentiable Spherical
Warping Layer to handle omnidirectional stereo geometry efficiently and
effectively. By utilizing the explicit stereo-based geometric constraints in
the stereo matching stage, PanoDepth can generate dense high-quality depth. We
conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate PanoDepth with
both the full pipeline as well as the individual modules in each stage. Our
results show that PanoDepth outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a
large margin for 360 monocular depth estimation.",None,-1

becoming increasingly popular. A meal delivery platform aims to provide
excellent and stable services for customers and restaurants. However, in
reality, several hundred thousand orders are canceled per day in the Meituan
meal delivery platform since they are not accepted by the crowd soucing
drivers. The cancellation of the orders is incredibly detrimental to the
customer's repurchase rate and the reputation of the Meituan meal delivery
platform. To solve this problem, a certain amount of specific funds is provided
by Meituan's business managers to encourage the crowdsourcing drivers to accept
more orders. To make better use of the funds, in this work, we propose a
framework to deal with the multi-stage bonus allocation problem for a meal
delivery platform. The objective of this framework is to maximize the number of
accepted orders within a limited bonus budget. This framework consists of a
semi-black-box acceptance probability model, a Lagrangian dual-based dynamic
programming algorithm, and an online allocation algorithm. The semi-black-box
acceptance probability model is employed to forecast the relationship between
the bonus allocated to order and its acceptance probability, the Lagrangian
dual-based dynamic programming algorithm aims to calculate the empirical
Lagrangian multiplier for each allocation stage offline based on the historical
data set, and the online allocation algorithm uses the results attained in the
offline part to calculate a proper delivery bonus for each order. To verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, both offline experiments on a
real-world data set and online A/B tests on the Meituan meal delivery platform
are conducted. Our results show that using the proposed framework, the total
order cancellations can be decreased by more than 25\% in reality.",None,-1

successes, they can be difficult to augment or maintain as needs shift.
Rule-based methods, on the other hand, can be more easily modified. However,
crafting rules requires expertise in linguistics and the domain of interest,
making it infeasible for most users. Here we attempt to combine the advantages
of these two directions while mitigating their drawbacks. We adapt recent
advances from the adjacent field of program synthesis to information
extraction, synthesizing rules from provided examples. We use a
transformer-based architecture to guide an enumerative search, and show that
this reduces the number of steps that need to be explored before a rule is
found. Further, we show that without training the synthesis algorithm on the
specific domain, our synthesized rules achieve state-of-the-art performance on
the 1-shot scenario of a task that focuses on few-shot learning for relation
classification, and competitive performance in the 5-shot scenario.",https://github.com/clulab/releases/tree/master/lrec2022-odinsynth,-1
