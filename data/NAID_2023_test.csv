distributions while minimizing a given cost function. In this regard, OT
between tractable prior distribution and data has been utilized for generative
modeling tasks. However, OT-based methods are susceptible to outliers and face
optimization challenges during training. In this paper, we propose a novel
generative model based on the semi-dual formulation of Unbalanced Optimal
Transport (UOT). Unlike OT, UOT relaxes the hard constraint on distribution
matching. This approach provides better robustness against outliers, stability
during training, and faster convergence. We validate these properties
empirically through experiments. Moreover, we study the theoretical upper-bound
of divergence between distributions in UOT. Our model outperforms existing
OT-based generative models, achieving FID scores of 2.97 on CIFAR-10 and 6.36
on CelebA-HQ-256. The code is available at

staying safe. A popular solution to Safe RL is shielding, which uses a logical
safety specification to prevent an RL agent from taking unsafe actions.
However, traditional shielding techniques are difficult to integrate with
continuous, end-to-end deep RL methods. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic
Logic Policy Gradient (PLPG). PLPG is a model-based Safe RL technique that uses
probabilistic logic programming to model logical safety constraints as
differentiable functions. Therefore, PLPG can be seamlessly applied to any
policy gradient algorithm while still providing the same convergence
guarantees. In our experiments, we show that PLPG learns safer and more
rewarding policies compared to other state-of-the-art shielding techniques.",None,-1

NeAT, a new state-of-the art feed-forward style transfer method. We

generation, resulting in a model which improves over the state-of-the-art in
both preserving the source content and matching the target style. An important
component of our model's success is identifying and fixing ""style halos"", a
commonly occurring artefact across many style transfer techniques. In addition

surprises if ran ""forever"" in Minecraft? While there is not a single path
toward solving that grand challenge, this article presents what we believe to
be some working ingredients for the endless generation of novel increasingly
complex artifacts in Minecraft. Our framework for an open-ended system includes
two components: a complex system used to recursively grow and complexify
artifacts over time, and a discovery algorithm that leverages the concept of
meta-diversity search. Since complex systems have shown to enable the emergence
of considerable complexity from set of simple rules, we believe them to be
great candidates to generate all sort of artifacts in Minecraft. Yet, the space
of possible artifacts that can be generated by these systems is often unknown,
challenging to characterize and explore. Therefore automating the long-term
discovery of novel and increasingly complex artifacts in these systems is an
exciting research field. To approach these challenges, we formulate the problem
of meta-diversity search where an artificial ""discovery assistant""
incrementally learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors
and searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them. A successful
discovery assistant should continuously seek for novel sources of diversities
while being able to quickly specialize the search toward a new unknown type of
diversity. To implement those ideas in the Minecraft environment, we simulate
an artificial ""chemistry"" system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton

a hierarchy of modular representations to characterize divergent sources of

Towards visual imperceptibility, some recent works explore unrestricted attacks

with well-designed content-preserving structures, we can generate
human-insensitive perturbations embedded with semantic clues. For better
transferability, we further ""deceive"" the diffusion model which can be viewed
as an implicit recognition surrogate, by distracting its attention away from

machine unlearning, where the learned models are endowed with the function to
forget information about specific training instances as if they have never

scenarios and largely ignores the essentials of unlearning in NLP field, where
text data contains more explicit and sensitive personal information than

induce forgetfulness. Different from previous work that tries to recover
gradients or forces models to perform close to one specific distribution, KGA
maintains distribution differences (i.e., knowledge gap). This relaxes the
distribution assumption. Furthermore, we first apply the unlearning method to
various NLP tasks (i.e., classification, translation, response generation) and

overgeneralization because of the high generalization abilities of
convolutional neural networks, leading to unreliable predictions. To mitigate
the overgeneralization, this study proposes to collaboratively optimize normal

optimization module and an overlap optimization module to optimize the two key
factors determining the localization performance, i.e., the margin and the
overlap between the discrepancy distributions (DDs) of normal and abnormal
samples. With CDO, a large margin and a small overlap between normal and
abnormal DDs are obtained, and the prediction reliability is boosted.
Experiments on MVTec2D and MVTec3D show that CDO effectively mitigates the

correlation disclosure -- affect fairness perception and parity. We find that
explanations help people detect direct but not indirect biases. Additionally,
regardless of bias type, explanations tend to increase agreement with model

a set of AU features from each facial representation; and (iii) a

autonomously in solving a task, but can request help from an external expert

few requests can lead to the robot making mistakes, but too many requests can
overload the expert. In this paper, we present a Reinforcement Learning based
approach to this problem, where a semi-autonomous agent asks for external
assistance when it has low confidence in the eventual success of the task. The
confidence level is computed by estimating the variance of the return from the
current state. We show that this estimate can be iteratively improved during
training using a Bellman-like recursion. On discrete navigation problems with
both fully- and partially-observable state information, we show that our method
makes effective use of a limited budget of expert calls at run-time, despite
having no access to the expert at training time.",None,-1

propose a transformer-based model with self-distillation (SDT) for the task.
The transformer-based model captures intra- and inter-modal interactions by
utilizing intra- and inter-modal transformers, and learns weights between
modalities dynamically by designing a hierarchical gated fusion strategy.
Furthermore, to learn more expressive modal representations, we treat soft
labels of the proposed model as extra training supervision. Specifically, we

exceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely
activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for

in prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model

Specifically, CP-WPIS first selects image views in which 3D candidate points of
an instance are fully visible. Then, we generate complementary background and
foreground prompts from projections to obtain SAM 2D instance mask predictions.
According to these, we assign the confidence values to points indicating the

to the ``scaling property'', where it is difficult for the model to capture
local structures through uniform sampling. To this end, we propose a new model

structural information and leveraging each local token information. To remedy
these problems, this paper proposes a superior FR model called TransFace, which
employs a patch-level data augmentation strategy named DPAP and a hard sample
mining strategy named EHSM. Specially, DPAP randomly perturbs the amplitude
information of dominant patches to expand sample diversity, which effectively
alleviates the overfitting problem in ViTs. EHSM utilizes the information
entropy in the local tokens to dynamically adjust the importance weight of easy
and hard samples during training, leading to a more stable prediction.

spurious correlations that are harmful to out-of-domain generalisation.
Furthermore, we introduce a full-permutation multi-task learning to alleviate
the spurious causal relations from intermediate sequences to the target, which

AI systems advising human decision makers -- presents a series of inconclusive
and confounding results. To synthesize these findings, we propose a simple
theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender
appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. We argue
explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision
maker to verify the correctness of an AI's prediction, in contrast to other
desiderata, e.g., interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process.
Prior studies find in many decision making contexts AI explanations do not
facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow
easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential
benefit of any type of explanation. We also compare the objective of
complementary performance with that of appropriate reliance, decomposing the
latter into the notions of outcome-graded and strategy-graded reliance.",None,-1

interest (AOI) or regions of interest (ROI), respectively, to the eye tracking
data quality and classification task. The first approach uses feature
importance in a greedy way and grows or shrinks AOIs in all directions. The
second approach is an extension of the first approach, which divides the AOIs
into areas and calculates a direction of growth, i.e. a gradient. Both
approaches improve the classification results considerably in the case of
generalized AOIs, but can also be used for qualitative analysis. In qualitative
analysis, the algorithms presented allow the AOIs to be adapted to the data,
which means that errors and inaccuracies in eye tracking data can be better
compensated for. A good application example is abstract art, where manual AOIs
annotation is hardly possible, and data-driven approaches are mainly used for
initial AOIs.

model that predicts the outcomes of actions. Errors in this predictive model
can degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov
decision processes (MDPs) can present exceptionally difficult prediction
problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA):
instead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on
a transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable,
easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much
as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate,
which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This
transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is
specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based
control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We
theoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to
significant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a

simultaneously by revisiting the idea of deformable convolution. We propose an
effective architecture that leverages deformable kernel convolution as a
single-pass refinement module, and empirically demonstrate its superiority. To
better understand the function of deformable convolution and exploit it for
depth completion, we further systematically investigate a variety of

syntactic task that involves grouping words in a non-hierarchical manner. We
present a two-layer Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) designed to
model word-to-chunk and chunk-to-sentence compositions. Our approach involves a
two-stage training process: pretraining with an unsupervised parser and
finetuning on downstream NLP tasks. Experiments on the CoNLL-2000 dataset
reveal a notable improvement over existing unsupervised methods, enhancing
phrase F1 score by up to 6 percentage points. Further, finetuning with
downstream tasks results in an additional performance improvement.
Interestingly, we observe that the emergence of the chunking structure is
transient during the neural model's downstream-task training. This study
contributes to the advancement of unsupervised syntactic structure discovery

challenging tasks in computer vision. This task is to localize the objects in
the images given only the image-level supervision. Recently, dividing WSOL into
two parts (class-agnostic object localization and object classification) has
become the state-of-the-art pipeline for this task. However, existing solutions
under this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are
not flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the
adopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo
bounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well
addressed. To remedy these drawbacks, we first propose to replace SCR with a
binary-class detector (BCD) for localizing multiple objects, where the detector

suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on
explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by
reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding
the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our

Consequently, contact neighborhoods are stored in an unordered manner and
contact features are difficult to align with image cues. At the core of our

this work, we propose a conditional text generation mechanism without the need
for predefined gender phrases and stereotypes. This approach employs three
types of inputs generated through three distinct strategies to probe LLMs,
aiming to show evidence of explicit and implicit gender biases in LLMs. We also
utilize explicit and implicit evaluation metrics to evaluate gender bias in
LLMs under different strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that an increased
model size does not consistently lead to enhanced fairness and all tested LLMs
exhibit explicit and/or implicit gender bias, even when explicit gender
stereotypes are absent in the inputs.",None,-1

training and fast sampling techniques for diffusion models. A remarkable
advancement is the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their
marginal-preserving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe data
perturbation and generative modeling in a unified framework. In this paper, we
carefully inspect the ODE-based sampling of a popular variance-exploding SDE
and reveal several intriguing structures of its sampling dynamics. We discover
that the data distribution and the noise distribution are smoothly connected
with a quasi-linear sampling trajectory and another implicit denoising
trajectory that even converges faster. Meanwhile, the denoising trajectory
governs the curvature of the corresponding sampling trajectory and its various
finite differences yield all second-order samplers used in practice.
Furthermore, we establish a theoretical relationship between the optimal
ODE-based sampling and the classic mean-shift (mode-seeking) algorithm, with
which we can characterize the asymptotic behavior of diffusion models and
identify the empirical score deviation.",None,-1

text-to-image domain. This paper studies their application as
observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential
environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured
correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices
in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias
into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these
choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for
imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the
joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models
suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures,
investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling
strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations

opportunities for 6G communications, e.g., network optimization and management
by allowing users to input task requirements to LLMs by nature language.
However, directly applying native LLMs in 6G encounters various challenges,
such as a lack of private communication data and knowledge, limited logical
reasoning, evaluation, and refinement abilities. Integrating LLMs with the
capabilities of retrieval, planning, memory, evaluation and reflection in
agents can greatly enhance the potential of LLMs for 6G communications. To this
end, we propose a multi-agent system with customized communication knowledge
and tools for solving communication related tasks using natural language,
comprising three components: (1) Multi-agent Data Retrieval (MDR), which
employs the condensate and inference agents to refine and summarize
communication knowledge from the knowledge base, expanding the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in 6G communications; (2) Multi-agent Collaborative Planning
(MCP), which utilizes multiple planning agents to generate feasible solutions
for the communication related task from different perspectives based on the
retrieved knowledge; (3) Multi-agent Evaluation and Reflecxion (MER), which
utilizes the evaluation agent to assess the solutions, and applies the
reflexion agent and refinement agent to provide improvement suggestions for
current solutions. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-agent system by designing a semantic communication system, as a case

geoscience applications such as agriculture, ecology, and natural disaster
management. Still, progress is often hindered by the limited training labels.
Given Earth imagery with limited training labels, a base deep neural network
model, and a spatial knowledge base with label constraints, our problem is to
infer the full labels while training the neural network. The problem is
challenging due to the sparse and noisy input labels, spatial uncertainty
within the label inference process, and high computational costs associated
with a large number of sample locations. Existing works on neuro-symbolic
models focus on integrating symbolic logic into neural networks (e.g., loss
function, model architecture, and training label augmentation), but these
methods do not fully address the challenges of spatial data (e.g., spatial
uncertainty, the trade-off between spatial granularity and computational
costs). To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Spatial Knowledge-Infused
Hierarchical Learning (SKI-HL) framework that iteratively infers sample labels
within a multi-resolution hierarchy. Our framework consists of a module to
selectively infer labels in different resolutions based on spatial uncertainty
and a module to train neural network parameters with uncertainty-aware
multi-instance learning. Extensive experiments on real-world flood mapping

on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks through fine-tuning. However,
fine-tuned models still suffer from overconfident predictions, especially in
out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we tackle the problem of calibrating
fine-tuned language models. We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on
the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under
domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to
catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream
classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the
calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that
preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned
language models. Among these methods, our proposed method that encourages the
fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language
modeling objective achieves competitive accuracy and the lowest expected
calibration error compared to several strong baselines under both in-domain and

the lack of large-scale counterfactual open-domain question-answering (QA)
benchmarks makes it difficult to evaluate and improve models on this ability.
To address this void, we introduce the first such dataset, named IfQA, where
each question is based on a counterfactual presupposition via an ""if"" clause.
For example, if Los Angeles was on the east coast of the U.S., what would be
the time difference between Los Angeles and Paris? Such questions require
models to go beyond retrieving direct factual knowledge from the Web: they must
identify the right information to retrieve and reason about an imagined
situation that may even go against the facts built into their parameters. The
IfQA dataset contains over 3,800 questions that were annotated annotated by
crowdworkers on relevant Wikipedia passages. Empirical analysis reveals that
the IfQA dataset is highly challenging for existing open-domain QA methods,
including supervised retrieve-then-read pipeline methods (EM score 36.2), as

challenge in simultaneously processing multiple agents lies in modeling complex
social interactions caused by various driving intentions and road conditions.
Previous methods typically leverage graph-based message propagation or
attention mechanism to encapsulate such interactions in the format of marginal
probabilistic distributions. However, it is inherently sub-optimal. In this
paper, we propose IPCC-TP, a novel relevance-aware module based on Incremental
Pearson Correlation Coefficient to improve multi-agent interaction modeling.
IPCC-TP learns pairwise joint Gaussian Distributions through the
tightly-coupled estimation of the means and covariances according to

variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature
extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid
networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of
feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This
paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct
interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent
low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into
the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent
levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information
conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive
spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies.
We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object
detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test

modalities into a unified space, our multimodal fusion module limits the
representations of different modalities independent while leverages bilinear
pooling for fusion and incorporates contrastive learning as additional

weighted average over the predictions of all modalities to better incorporate
the complementarity of different modalities. Our approach has been demonstrated
