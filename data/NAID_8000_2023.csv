SST: A Simplified Swin Transformer-based Model for Taxi Destination Prediction based on Existing Trajectory,0.648752,"Accurately predicting the destination of taxi trajectories can have various
benefits for intelligent location-based services. One potential method to
accomplish this prediction is by converting the taxi trajectory into a
two-dimensional grid and using computer vision techniques. While the Swin
Transformer is an innovative computer vision architecture with demonstrated
success in vision downstream tasks, it is not commonly used to solve real-world
trajectory problems. In this paper, we propose a simplified Swin Transformer
(SST) structure that does not use the shifted window idea in the traditional
Swin Transformer, as trajectory data is consecutive in nature. Our
comprehensive experiments, based on real trajectory data, demonstrate that SST
can achieve higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",None,-1
Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Diffusion Inpainting,0.915165,"Unsupervised out-of-distribution detection (OOD) seeks to identify
out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled in-domain data. We present a
novel approach for this task - Lift, Map, Detect (LMD) - that leverages recent
advancement in diffusion models. Diffusion models are one type of generative
models. At their core, they learn an iterative denoising process that gradually
maps a noisy image closer to their training manifolds. LMD leverages this
intuition for OOD detection. Specifically, LMD lifts an image off its original
manifold by corrupting it, and maps it towards the in-domain manifold with a
diffusion model. For an out-of-domain image, the mapped image would have a
large distance away from its original manifold, and LMD would identify it as
OOD accordingly. We show through extensive experiments that LMD achieves
competitive performance across a broad variety of datasets. Code can be found

Learning Instance-Level Representation for Large-Scale Multi-Modal Pretraining in E-commerce,0.154976,"This paper aims to establish a generic multi-modal foundation model that has
the scalable capability to massive downstream applications in E-commerce.
Recently, large-scale vision-language pretraining approaches have achieved
remarkable advances in the general domain. However, due to the significant
differences between natural and product images, directly applying these
frameworks for modeling image-level representations to E-commerce will be
inevitably sub-optimal. To this end, we propose an instance-centric multi-modal
pretraining paradigm called ECLIP in this work. In detail, we craft a decoder
architecture that introduces a set of learnable instance queries to explicitly
aggregate instance-level semantics. Moreover, to enable the model to focus on
the desired product instance without reliance on expensive manual annotations,
two specially configured pretext tasks are further proposed. Pretrained on the
100 million E-commerce-related data, ECLIP successfully extracts more generic,
semantic-rich, and robust representations. Extensive experimental results show
that, without further fine-tuning, ECLIP surpasses existing methods by a large
margin on a broad range of downstream tasks, demonstrating the strong
transferability to real-world E-commerce applications.",None,-1
How Generalizable are Deepfake Detectors? An Empirical Study,0.113636,"Deepfake videos and images are becoming increasingly credible, posing a
significant threat given their potential to facilitate fraud or bypass access
control systems. This has motivated the development of deepfake detection
methods, in which deep learning models are trained to distinguish between real
and synthesized footage. Unfortunately, existing detection models struggle to
generalize to deepfakes from datasets they were not trained on, but little work
has been done to examine why or how this limitation can be addressed. In this
paper, we present the first empirical study on the generalizability of deepfake
detectors, an essential goal for detectors to stay one step ahead of attackers.
Our study utilizes six deepfake datasets, five deepfake detection methods, and
two model augmentation approaches, confirming that detectors do not generalize
in zero-shot settings. Additionally, we find that detectors are learning
unwanted properties specific to synthesis methods and struggling to extract
discriminative features, limiting their ability to generalize. Finally, we find
that there are neurons universally contributing to detection across seen and
unseen datasets, illuminating a possible path forward to zero-shot
generalizability.",None,-1
Meta Generative Attack on Person Reidentification,0.188594,"Adversarial attacks have been recently investigated in person

we propose our method with the goal of achieving better transferability against
different models and across datasets. We generate a mask to obtain better

practical challenges.",None,-1
Redefining Digital Health Interfaces with Large Language Models,0.668982,"Digital health tools have the potential to significantly improve the delivery

of potential applications in healthcare. Directly applying LLMs in clinical
settings is not straightforward, however, with LLMs susceptible to providing
inconsistent or nonsensical answers. We demonstrate how LLM-based systems can
utilize external tools and provide a novel interface between clinicians and
digital technologies. This enhances the utility and practical impact of digital
healthcare tools and AI models while addressing current issues with using LLMs
in clinical settings such as hallucinations. We illustrate LLM-based interfaces

Protecting Society from AI Misuse: When are Restrictions on Capabilities Warranted?,0.380979,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems will increasingly be used to cause harm
as they grow more capable. In fact, AI systems are already starting to be used
to automate fraudulent activities, violate human rights, create harmful fake
images, and identify dangerous toxins. To prevent some misuses of AI, we argue
that targeted interventions on certain capabilities will be warranted. These
restrictions may include controlling who can access certain types of AI models,
what they can be used for, whether outputs are filtered or can be traced back
to their user, and the resources needed to develop them. We also contend that
some restrictions on non-AI capabilities needed to cause harm will be required.
Though capability restrictions risk reducing use more than misuse (facing an
unfavorable Misuse-Use Tradeoff), we argue that interventions on capabilities
are warranted when other interventions are insufficient, the potential harm
from misuse is high, and there are targeted ways to intervene on capabilities.
We provide a taxonomy of interventions that can reduce AI misuse, focusing on
the specific steps required for a misuse to cause harm (the Misuse Chain), and
a framework to determine if an intervention is warranted. We apply this
reasoning to three examples: predicting novel toxins, creating harmful images,
and automating spear phishing campaigns.",None,-1
Analyzing Intentional Behavior in Autonomous Agents under Uncertainty,0.0990424,"Principled accountability for autonomous decision-making in uncertain
environments requires distinguishing intentional outcomes from negligent
designs from actual accidents. We propose analyzing the behavior of autonomous
agents through a quantitative measure of the evidence of intentional behavior.
We model an uncertain environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). For a
given scenario, we rely on probabilistic model checking to compute the ability
of the agent to influence reaching a certain event. We call this the scope of
agency. We say that there is evidence of intentional behavior if the scope of
agency is high and the decisions of the agent are close to being optimal for
reaching the event. Our method applies counterfactual reasoning to
automatically generate relevant scenarios that can be analyzed to increase the
confidence of our assessment. In a case study, we show how our method can
distinguish between 'intentional' and 'accidental' traffic collisions.",None,-1
How are Prompts Different in Terms of Sensitivity?,0.268575,"In-context learning (ICL) has become one of the most popular learning
paradigms. While there is a growing body of literature focusing on prompt
engineering, there is a lack of systematic analysis comparing the effects of
prompts across different models and tasks. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive prompt analysis based on the sensitivity of a function. Our
analysis reveals that sensitivity is an unsupervised proxy for model
performance, as it exhibits a strong negative correlation with accuracy. We use
gradient-based saliency scores to empirically demonstrate how different prompts
affect the relevance of input tokens to the output, resulting in different
levels of sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce sensitivity-aware decoding
which incorporates sensitivity estimation as a penalty term in the standard
greedy decoding. We show that this approach is particularly helpful when
information in the input is scarce. Our work provides a fresh perspective on
the analysis of prompts, and contributes to a better understanding of the

open-domain question answering. Specifically, we undertake a detailed
examination of ChatGPT's failures, categorized into: comprehension, factuality,

contributing failure and identify two critical abilities associated with
factuality: knowledge memorization and knowledge recall. Through experiments

Emotionally Enhanced Talking Face Generation,0.609572,"Several works have developed end-to-end pipelines for generating lip-synced
talking faces with various real-world applications, such as teaching and
language translation in videos. However, these prior works fail to create
realistic-looking videos since they focus little on people's expressions and
emotions. Moreover, these methods' effectiveness largely depends on the faces
in the training dataset, which means they may not perform well on unseen faces.
To mitigate this, we build a talking face generation framework conditioned on a
categorical emotion to generate videos with appropriate expressions, making
them more realistic and convincing. With a broad range of six emotions, i.e.,
\emph{happiness}, \emph{sadness}, \emph{fear}, \emph{anger}, \emph{disgust},

Benchmarking the Abilities of Large Language Models for RDF Knowledge Graph Creation and Comprehension: How Well Do LLMs Speak Turtle?,0.807754,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at a rapid pace, with significant
improvements at natural language processing and coding tasks. Yet, their
ability to work with formal languages representing data, specifically within
the realm of knowledge graph engineering, remains under-investigated. To

SOCS: Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation under Large Shape Variations,0.572665,"Most learning-based approaches to category-level 6D pose estimation are
design around normalized object coordinate space (NOCS). While being
successful, NOCS-based methods become inaccurate and less robust when handling
objects of a category containing significant intra-category shape variations.
This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of
objects are semantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to
learn and generalize. We propose Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space
(SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of
keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is semantically
coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically
meaningful location in SOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation
under large shape variations. To learn effective coordinate regression to SOCS,
we propose a novel multi-scale coordinate-based attention network. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method is easy to train, well-generalizing for large
intra-category shape variations and robust to inter-object occlusions.",None,-1
Integrating Semantic Information into Sketchy Reading Module of Retro-Reader for Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension,0.40413,"Machine Reading Comprehension has become one of the most advanced and popular

USIM-DAL: Uncertainty-aware Statistical Image Modeling-based Dense Active Learning for Super-resolution,0.397103,"Dense regression is a widely used approach in computer vision for tasks such
as image super-resolution, enhancement, depth estimation, etc. However, the
high cost of annotation and labeling makes it challenging to achieve accurate
results. We propose incorporating active learning into dense regression models

informative samples for labeling, reducing the overall annotation cost while
improving performance. Despite its potential, active learning has not been
widely explored in high-dimensional computer vision regression tasks like
super-resolution. We address this research gap and propose a new framework
called USIM-DAL that leverages the statistical properties of colour images to
learn informative priors using probabilistic deep neural networks that model
the heteroscedastic predictive distribution allowing uncertainty
quantification. Moreover, the aleatoric uncertainty from the network serves as
a proxy for error that is used for active learning. Our experiments on a wide

Toward Unsupervised Realistic Visual Question Answering,0.0722922,"The problem of realistic VQA (RVQA), where a model has to reject unanswerable

out 2 drawbacks in current RVQA research, where (1) datasets contain too many

training. To resolve the first drawback, we propose a new testing dataset,
RGQA, which combines AQs from an existing VQA dataset with around 29K
human-annotated UQs. These UQs consist of both fine-grained and coarse-grained
image-question pairs generated with 2 approaches: CLIP-based and
Perturbation-based. To address the second drawback, we introduce an
unsupervised training approach. This combines pseudo UQs obtained by randomly
pairing images and questions, with an RoI Mixup procedure to generate more
fine-grained pseudo UQs, and model ensembling to regularize model confidence.
Experiments show that using pseudo UQs significantly outperforms RVQA
baselines. RoI Mixup and model ensembling further increase the gain. Finally,

Diagnostic Reasoning Prompts Reveal the Potential for Large Language Model Interpretability in Medicine,0.862896,"One of the major barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in medicine

this manuscript we develop novel diagnostic reasoning prompts to study whether

that GPT4 can be prompted to mimic the common clinical reasoning processes of
clinicians without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. This is significant because
an LLM that can use clinical reasoning to provide an interpretable rationale
offers physicians a means to evaluate whether LLMs can be trusted for patient
care. Novel prompting methods have the potential to expose the black box of
LLMs, bringing them one step closer to safe and effective use in medicine.",None,-1
Generating a Structured Summary of Numerous Academic Papers: Dataset and Method,0.404529,"Writing a survey paper on one research topic usually needs to cover the

Meta-Learned Models of Cognition,0.725674,"Meta-learning is a framework for learning learning algorithms through
repeated interactions with an environment as opposed to designing them by hand.
In recent years, this framework has established itself as a promising tool for
building models of human cognition. Yet, a coherent research program around
meta-learned models of cognition is still missing. The purpose of this article
is to synthesize previous work in this field and establish such a research
program. We rely on three key pillars to accomplish this goal. We first point
out that meta-learning can be used to construct Bayes-optimal learning
algorithms. This result not only implies that any behavioral phenomenon that
can be explained by a Bayesian model can also be explained by a meta-learned
model but also allows us to draw strong connections to the rational analysis of
cognition. We then discuss several advantages of the meta-learning framework

can be applied to situations where Bayesian inference is impossible and that it
enables us to make rational models of cognition more realistic, either by
incorporating limited computational resources or neuroscientific knowledge.
Finally, we reexamine prior studies from psychology and neuroscience that have

Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Charge Prediction on Unprofessional Descriptions,0.0546637,"Recent works considering professional legal-linguistic style (PLLS) texts

Multimodal Machine Unlearning,0.731273,"Machine Unlearning is the process of removing specific training data samples
and their corresponding effects from an already trained model. It has
significant practical benefits, such as purging private, inaccurate, or
outdated information from trained models without the need for complete
re-training. Unlearning within a multimodal setting presents unique challenges
due to the intrinsic dependencies between different data modalities and the
expensive cost of training on large multimodal datasets and architectures.
Current approaches to machine unlearning have not fully addressed these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMUL, a machine unlearning
approach specifically designed for multimodal data and models. MMUL formulates
the multimodal unlearning task by focusing on three key properties: (a):
modality decoupling, which effectively decouples the association between
individual unimodal data points within multimodal inputs marked for deletion,
rendering them as unrelated data points within the model's context, (b):
unimodal knowledge retention, which retains the unimodal representation
capability of the model post-unlearning, and (c): multimodal knowledge
retention, which retains the multimodal representation capability of the model
post-unlearning. MMUL is efficient to train and is not constrained by the
requirement of using a strongly convex loss. Experiments on two multimodal
models and four multimodal benchmark datasets, including vision-language and
graph-language datasets, show that MMUL outperforms existing baselines, gaining
an average improvement of +17.6 points against the best-performing unimodal
baseline in distinguishing between deleted and remaining data. In addition,
MMUL can largely maintain pre-existing knowledge of the original model post

Enhancing Cross-lingual Transfer via Phonemic Transcription Integration,0.49446,"Previous cross-lingual transfer methods are restricted to orthographic
representation learning via textual scripts. This limitation hampers
cross-lingual transfer and is biased towards languages sharing similar
well-known scripts. To alleviate the gap between languages from different
writing scripts, we propose PhoneXL, a framework incorporating phonemic
transcriptions as an additional linguistic modality beyond the traditional
orthographic transcriptions for cross-lingual transfer. Particularly, we
propose unsupervised alignment objectives to capture (1) local one-to-one
alignment between the two different modalities, (2) alignment via
multi-modality contexts to leverage information from additional modalities, and
(3) alignment via multilingual contexts where additional bilingual dictionaries
are incorporated. We also release the first phonemic-orthographic alignment
dataset on two token-level tasks (Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech
Tagging) among the understudied but interconnected
Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese (CJKV) languages. Our pilot study reveals
phonemic transcription provides essential information beyond the orthography to

SQuARe: A Large-Scale Dataset of Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Responses Created Through Human-Machine Collaboration,0.280043,"The potential social harms that large language models pose, such as

Augmentation-Adapted Retriever Improves Generalization of Language Models as Generic Plug-In,0.722883,"Retrieval augmentation can aid language models (LMs) in knowledge-intensive
tasks by supplying them with external information. Prior works on retrieval
augmentation usually jointly fine-tune the retriever and the LM, making them
closely coupled. In this paper, we explore the scheme of generic retrieval

or are unable to be fine-tuned together. To retrieve useful documents for
unseen target LMs, we propose augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which
learns LM's preferences obtained from a known source LM. Experiments on the
MMLU and PopQA datasets demonstrate that our AAR trained with a small source LM

Depth-Relative Self Attention for Monocular Depth Estimation,0.512263,"Monocular depth estimation is very challenging because clues to the exact

overly exploited, the network can be biased on RGB information without
considering the comprehensive view. We propose a novel depth estimation model
named RElative Depth Transformer (RED-T) that uses relative depth as guidance
in self-attention. Specifically, the model assigns high attention weights to
pixels of close depth and low attention weights to pixels of distant depth. As
a result, the features of similar depth can become more likely to each other
and thus less prone to misused visual hints. We show that the proposed model
achieves competitive results in monocular depth estimation benchmarks and is

Coarse-to-Fine Multi-Scene Pose Regression with Transformers,0.341869,"Absolute camera pose regressors estimate the position and orientation of a
camera given the captured image alone. Typically, a convolutional backbone with

regression with Transformers, where encoders are used to aggregate activation
maps with self-attention and decoders transform latent features and scenes

Generalizable Decision Boundaries: Dualistic Meta-Learning for Open Set Domain Generalization,0.548189,"Domain generalization (DG) is proposed to deal with the issue of domain

To overcome this deficiency, open set domain generalization (OSDG) then emerges
as a more practical setting to recognize unseen classes in unseen domains. An
intuitive approach is to use multiple one-vs-all classifiers to define decision
boundaries for each class and reject the outliers as unknown. However, the
significant class imbalance between positive and negative samples often causes
the boundaries biased towards positive ones, resulting in misclassification for
known samples in the unseen target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel

address this, we focus on reducing the data used in LLM instruction tuning to
decrease training costs and improve data efficiency, dubbed as Low Training
Data Instruction Tuning (LTD Instruction Tuning). Specifically, this paper
conducts a preliminary exploration into reducing the data used in LLM training
and identifies several observations regarding task specialization for LLM
training, such as the optimization of performance for a specific task, the
number of instruction types required for instruction tuning, and the amount of
data required for task-specific models. The results suggest that task-specific
models can be trained using less than 0.5% of the original dataset, with a 2%

Additive manifesto decomposition: A policy domain aware method for understanding party positioning,0.263957,"Automatic extraction of party (dis)similarities from texts such as party
election manifestos or parliamentary speeches plays an increasing role in
computational political science. However, existing approaches are fundamentally
limited to targeting only global party (dis)-similarity: they condense the
relationship between a pair of parties into a single figure, their similarity.
In aggregating over all policy domains (e.g., health or foreign policy), they
do not provide any qualitative insights into which domains parties agree or
disagree on. This paper proposes a workflow for estimating policy domain aware
party similarity that overcomes this limitation. The workflow covers (a)
definition of suitable policy domains; (b) automatic labeling of domains, if no
manual labels are available; (c) computation of domain-level similarities and
aggregation at a global level; (d) extraction of interpretable party positions
on major policy axes via multidimensional scaling. We evaluate our workflow on
manifestos from the German federal elections. We find that our method (a)
yields high correlation when predicting party similarity at a global level and
(b) provides accurate party-specific positions, even with automatically
labelled policy domains.",None,-1
Zero-touch realization of Pervasive Artificial Intelligence-as-a-service in 6G networks,0.813266,"The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies, characterized by ultra-dense

still in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize
its design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this

Prompt Tuning based Adapter for Vision-Language Model Adaption,0.0630394,"Large pre-trained vision-language (VL) models have shown significant promise

of the target domain data. Our experiments on four different domains
demonstrate that $k$NN-Adapter significantly improves perplexity, and works

Further leveraging deep metric learning for unsupervised clustering, allows us
to segment the chart plot area into various objects. By further matching the

ATTA: Anomaly-aware Test-Time Adaptation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Segmentation,0.766259,"Recent advancements in dense out-of-distribution (OOD) detection have
primarily focused on scenarios where the training and testing datasets share a
similar domain, with the assumption that no domain shift exists between them.
However, in real-world situations, domain shift often exits and significantly

this work, we propose a dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain
shift and semantic shift jointly. The first level distinguishes whether domain
shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the
second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense
high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to

We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation

Knowledge Solver: Teaching LLMs to Search for Domain Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs,0.924968,"Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are versatile and
can solve different tasks due to their emergent ability and generalizability.
However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which
would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works,
additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved
knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of
lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules:
1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2)
would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized
for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver

bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design
a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision
sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot
manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and
therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct

Content-aware Token Sharing for Efficient Semantic Segmentation with Vision Transformers,0.378468,"This paper introduces Content-aware Token Sharing (CTS), a token reduction

the same semantic class, as they contain redundant information. Our approach
leverages this by employing an efficient, class-agnostic policy network that
predicts if image patches contain the same semantic class, and lets them share

Understanding In-Context Learning from Repetitions,0.0976668,"This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning in

Transfer Learning for Fine-grained Classification Using Semi-supervised Learning and Visual Transformers,0.756061,"Fine-grained classification is a challenging task that involves identifying
subtle differences between objects within the same category. This task is

their ability to learn highly expressive representations of visual data using
self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we explore Semi-ViT, a ViT model fine
tuned using semi-supervised learning techniques, suitable for situations where
we have lack of annotated data. This is particularly common in e-commerce,
where images are readily available but labels are noisy, nonexistent, or
expensive to obtain. Our results demonstrate that Semi-ViT outperforms

Over two experiments, we elicit human judgments on a range of property
induction tasks spanning multiple domains. Although GPT-3.5 struggles to
capture many aspects of human behaviour, GPT-4 is much more successful: for the
most part, its performance qualitatively matches that of humans, and the only

WP-AIGC can also accept user's feedback, allowing adjustment of computing

Towards Accurate Image Coding: Improved Autoregressive Image Generation with Dynamic Vector Quantization,0.221994,"Existing vector quantization (VQ) based autoregressive models follow a
two-stage generation paradigm that first learns a codebook to encode images as

However, they encode fixed-size image regions into fixed-length codes and
ignore their naturally different information densities, which results in
insufficiency in important regions and redundancy in unimportant ones, and
finally degrades the generation quality and speed. Moreover, the fixed-length
coding leads to an unnatural raster-scan autoregressive generation. To address
the problem, we propose a novel two-stage framework: (1) Dynamic-Quantization

Debiasing Made State-of-the-art: Revisiting the Simple Seed-based Weak Supervision for Text Classification,0.168171,"Recent advances in weakly supervised text classification mostly focus on
designing sophisticated methods to turn high-level human heuristics into

seed-match rule, which prevents the classifier from learning reliable
confidence for selecting high-quality pseudo-labels. Interestingly, simply
deleting the seed words present in the matched input texts can mitigate the
label bias and help learn better confidence. Subsequently, the performance
achieved by seed matching can be improved significantly, making it on par with
or even better than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, to handle the case when

Data Augmentation Alone Can Improve Adversarial Training,0.916317,"Adversarial training suffers from the issue of robust overfitting, which
seriously impairs its generalization performance. Data augmentation, which is
effective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by
many previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial
training. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data
augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in
adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data
augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general,
diversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost
robustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both
over that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop
transformation, Cropshift, which has improved diversity compared to the
conventional one (Padcrop). We then propose a new data augmentation scheme,
based on Cropshift, with much improved diversity and well-balanced hardness.
Empirically, our augmentation method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness for data augmentations in adversarial training. Furthermore, when
combined with weight averaging it matches, or even exceeds, the performance of
the best contemporary regularization methods for alleviating robust

TUTORING: Instruction-Grounded Conversational Agent for Language Learners,0.0620104,"In this paper, we propose Tutoring bot, a generative chatbot trained on a
large scale of tutor-student conversations for English-language learning. To
mimic a human tutor's behavior in language education, the tutor bot leverages

GPT-Lab: Next Generation Of Optimal Chemistry Discovery By GPT Driven Robotic Lab,0.406418,"The integration of robots in chemical experiments has enhanced experimental

Unsupervised Inference of Signed Distance Functions from Single Sparse Point Clouds without Learning Priors,0.66934,"It is vital to infer signed distance functions (SDFs) from 3D point clouds.
The latest methods rely on generalizing the priors learned from large scale
supervision. However, the learned priors do not generalize well to various
geometric variations that are unseen during training, especially for extremely
sparse point clouds. To resolve this issue, we present a neural network to
directly infer SDFs from single sparse point clouds without using signed
distance supervision, learned priors or even normals. Our insight here is to
learn surface parameterization and SDFs inference in an end-to-end manner. To
make up the sparsity, we leverage parameterized surfaces as a coarse surface
sampler to provide many coarse surface estimations in training iterations,
according to which we mine supervision and our thin plate splines (TPS) based
network infers SDFs as smooth functions in a statistical way. Our method
significantly improves the generalization ability and accuracy in unseen point
clouds. Our experimental results show our advantages over the state-of-the-art
methods in surface reconstruction for sparse point clouds under synthetic

Conversational Semantic Parsing using Dynamic Context Graphs,0.353777,"In this paper we consider the task of conversational semantic parsing over
general purpose knowledge graphs (KGs) with millions of entities, and thousands
of relation-types. We focus on models which are capable of interactively
mapping user utterances into executable logical forms (e.g., Sparql) in the
context of the conversational history. Our key idea is to represent information
about an utterance and its context via a subgraph which is created dynamically,
i.e., the number of nodes varies per utterance. Rather than treating the
subgraph as a sequence, we exploit its underlying structure and encode it with
a graph neural network which further allows us to represent a large number of
(unseen) nodes. Experimental results show that dynamic context modeling is
superior to static approaches, delivering performance improvements across the
board (i.e., for simple and complex questions). Our results further confirm
that modeling the structure of context is better at processing discourse

interactions.",None,-1
Split-NER: Named Entity Recognition via Two Question-Answering-based Classifications,0.95875,"In this work, we address the NER problem by splitting it into two logical

efficient. Our system, SplitNER outperforms baselines on OntoNotes5.0, WNUT17

NeMF: Inverse Volume Rendering with Neural Microflake Field,0.750486,"Recovering the physical attributes of an object's appearance from its images

conduct inverse volume rendering, in contrast to surface-based, by representing
a scene using microflake volume, which assumes the space is filled with
infinite small flakes and light reflects or scatters at each spatial location

How can objects help action recognition?,0.414735,"Current state-of-the-art video models process a video clip as a long sequence
of spatio-temporal tokens. However, they do not explicitly model objects, their
interactions across the video, and instead process all the tokens in the video.
In this paper, we investigate how we can use knowledge of objects to design
better video models, namely to process fewer tokens and to improve recognition
accuracy. This is in contrast to prior works which either drop tokens at the
cost of accuracy, or increase accuracy whilst also increasing the computation
required. First, we propose an object-guided token sampling strategy that
enables us to retain a small fraction of the input tokens with minimal impact
on accuracy. And second, we propose an object-aware attention module that
enriches our feature representation with object information and improves
overall accuracy. Our resulting framework achieves better performance when
using fewer tokens than strong baselines. In particular, we match our baseline
with 30%, 40%, and 60% of the input tokens on SomethingElse,

A Parametric Similarity Method: Comparative Experiments based on Semantically Annotated Large Datasets,0.280527,"We present the parametric method SemSimp aimed at measuring semantic

In particular, weights can be computed by considering either the available
digital resources or the structure of the reference ontology of a given domain.
SemSimp is assessed against six representative semantic similarity methods for
comparing sets of concepts proposed in the literature, by carrying out an
experimentation that includes both a statistical analysis and an expert
judgement evaluation. To the purpose of achieving a reliable assessment, we
used a real-world large dataset based on the Digital Library of the Association

design of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process
is cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different
passwords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct
password, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to
maintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient
implementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor.

Zero-1-to-3: Domain-level Zero-shot Cognitive Diagnosis via One Batch of Early-bird Students towards Three Diagnostic Objectives,0.548665,"Cognitive diagnosis seeks to estimate the cognitive states of students by
exploring their logged practice quiz data. It plays a pivotal role in
personalized learning guidance within intelligent education systems. In this
paper, we focus on an important, practical, yet often underexplored task:
domain-level zero-shot cognitive diagnosis (DZCD), which arises due to the
absence of student practice logs in newly launched domains. Recent cross-domain
diagnostic models have been demonstrated to be a promising strategy for DZCD.
These methods primarily focus on how to transfer student states across domains.
However, they might inadvertently incorporate non-transferable information into
student representations, thereby limiting the efficacy of knowledge transfer.
To tackle this, we propose Zero-1-to-3, a domain-level zero-shot cognitive
diagnosis framework via one batch of early-bird students towards three
diagnostic objectives. Our approach initiates with pre-training a diagnosis
model with dual regularizers, which decouples student states into domain-shared
and domain-specific parts. The shared cognitive signals can be transferred to
the target domain, enriching the cognitive priors for the new domain, which
ensures the cognitive state propagation objective. Subsequently, we devise a
strategy to generate simulated practice logs for cold-start students through
analyzing the behavioral patterns from early-bird students, fulfilling the
domain-adaption goal. Consequently, we refine the cognitive states of
cold-start students as diagnostic outcomes via virtual data, aligning with the
diagnosis-oriented goal. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world
datasets highlight the efficacy of our model for DZCD and its practical
application in question recommendation. The code is publicly available at

A New Class of Explanations for Classifiers with Non-Binary Features,0.423838,"Two types of explanations have been receiving increased attention in the
literature when analyzing the decisions made by classifiers. The first type

reason for the decision, also a contrastive or counterfactual explanation.
These explanations were defined for classifiers with binary, discrete and, in
some cases, continuous features. We show that these explanations can be
significantly improved in the presence of non-binary features, leading to a new
class of explanations that relay more information about decisions and the
underlying classifiers. Necessary and sufficient reasons were also shown to be
the prime implicates and implicants of the complete reason for a decision,

A store-and-forward cloud-based telemonitoring system for automatic assessing dysarthria evolution in neurological diseases from video-recording analysis,0.900509,"Background and objectives: Patients suffering from neurological diseases may

Close and quantitative monitoring of dysarthria evolution is crucial for

Grammar Prompting for Domain-Specific Language Generation with Large Language Models,0.484226,"Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of natural

Learning with Exposure Constraints in Recommendation Systems,0.414813,"Recommendation systems are dynamic economic systems that balance the needs of
multiple stakeholders. A recent line of work studies incentives from the
content providers' point of view. Content providers, e.g., vloggers and
bloggers, contribute fresh content and rely on user engagement to create
revenue and finance their operations. In this work, we propose a contextual
multi-armed bandit setting to model the dependency of content providers on
exposure. In our model, the system receives a user context in every round and
has to select one of the arms. Every arm is a content provider who must receive
a minimum number of pulls every fixed time period (e.g., a month) to remain
viable in later rounds; otherwise, the arm departs and is no longer available.
The system aims to maximize the users' (content consumers) welfare. To that
end, it should learn which arms are vital and ensure they remain viable by
subsidizing arm pulls if needed. We develop algorithms with sub-linear regret,
as well as a lower bound that demonstrates that our algorithms are optimal up
to logarithmic factors.",None,-1
Causal Structure Learning Supervised by Large Language Model,0.883309,"Causal discovery from observational data is pivotal for deciphering complex
relationships. Causal Structure Learning (CSL), which focuses on deriving
causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from data, faces challenges due to vast
DAG spaces and data sparsity. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
recognized for their causal reasoning capabilities, offers a promising
direction to enhance CSL by infusing it with knowledge-based causal inferences.
However, existing approaches utilizing LLMs for CSL have encountered issues,
including unreliable constraints from imperfect LLM inferences and the
computational intensity of full pairwise variable analyses. In response, we
introduce the Iterative LLM Supervised CSL (ILS-CSL) framework. ILS-CSL
innovatively integrates LLM-based causal inference with CSL in an iterative
process, refining the causal DAG using feedback from LLMs. This method not only
utilizes LLM resources more efficiently but also generates more robust and
high-quality structural constraints compared to previous methodologies. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight real-world datasets demonstrates
ILS-CSL's superior performance, setting a new standard in CSL efficacy and
showcasing its potential to significantly advance the field of causal

Automatic Truss Design with Reinforcement Learning,0.318084,"Truss layout design, namely finding a lightweight truss layout satisfying all

sparse rewards for RL training. In this paper, we develop AutoTruss, a
two-stage framework to efficiently generate both lightweight and valid truss
layouts. AutoTruss first adopts Monte Carlo tree search to discover a diverse

Applying Plain Transformers to Real-World Point Clouds,0.134066,"To apply transformer-based models to point cloud understanding, many previous
works modify the architecture of transformers by using, e.g., local attention

TemporalMaxer: Maximize Temporal Context with only Max Pooling for Temporal Action Localization,0.889456,"Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a challenging task in video

Spatiotemporal Deformation Perception for Fisheye Video Rectification,0.340046,"Although the distortion correction of fisheye images has been extensively
studied, the correction of fisheye videos is still an elusive challenge. For
different frames of the fisheye video, the existing image correction methods
ignore the correlation of sequences, resulting in temporal jitter in the
corrected video. To solve this problem, we propose a temporal weighting scheme
to get a plausible global optical flow, which mitigates the jitter effect by
progressively reducing the weight of frames. Subsequently, we observe that the
inter-frame optical flow of the video is facilitated to perceive the local
spatial deformation of the fisheye video. Therefore, we derive the spatial
deformation through the flows of fisheye and distorted-free videos, thereby
enhancing the local accuracy of the predicted result. However, the independent
correction for each frame disrupts the temporal correlation. Due to the
property of fisheye video, a distorted moving object may be able to find its
distorted-free pattern at another moment. To this end, a temporal deformation

UniDistill: A Universal Cross-Modality Knowledge Distillation Framework for 3D Object Detection in Bird's-Eye View,0.894304,"In the field of 3D object detection for autonomous driving, the sensor
portfolio including multi-modality and single-modality is diverse and complex.
Since the multi-modal methods have system complexity while the accuracy of

difficult. In this work, we propose a universal cross-modality knowledge
distillation framework (UniDistill) to improve the performance of
single-modality detectors. Specifically, during training, UniDistill projects
the features of both the teacher and the student detector into Bird's-Eye-View

distillation losses are calculated to sparsely align the foreground features,
helping the student learn from the teacher without introducing additional cost
during inference. Taking advantage of the similar detection paradigm of
different detectors in BEV, UniDistill easily supports LiDAR-to-camera,
camera-to-LiDAR, fusion-to-LiDAR and fusion-to-camera distillation paths.
Furthermore, the three distillation losses can filter the effect of misaligned

improving the distillation effectiveness. Extensive experiments on nuScenes

ReCOGS: How Incidental Details of a Logical Form Overshadow an Evaluation of Semantic Interpretation,0.558938,"Compositional generalization benchmarks for semantic parsing seek to assess
whether models can accurately compute meanings for novel sentences, but
operationalize this in terms of logical form (LF) prediction. This raises the
concern that semantically irrelevant details of the chosen LFs could shape

present-day models, which could be taken as an indictment of those models.
However, we show that the negative results trace to incidental features of COGS
LFs. Converting these LFs to semantically equivalent ones and factoring out
capabilities unrelated to semantic interpretation, we find that even baseline
models get traction. A recent variable-free translation of COGS LFs suggests
similar conclusions, but we observe this format is not semantically equivalent;
it is incapable of accurately representing some COGS meanings. These findings

Learning to Optimize for Reinforcement Learning,0.0574946,"In recent years, by leveraging more data, computation, and diverse tasks,

Knowing What LLMs DO NOT Know: A Simple Yet Effective Self-Detection Method,0.308445,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent literature reveals that LLMs generate
nonfactual responses intermittently, which impedes the LLMs' reliability for
further utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel self-detection method to
detect which questions that a LLM does not know that are prone to generate
nonfactual results. Specifically, we first diversify the textual expressions
for a given question and collect the corresponding answers. Then we examine the
divergencies between the generated answers to identify the questions that the
model may generate falsehoods. All of the above steps can be accomplished by
prompting the LLMs themselves without referring to any other external
resources. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on recently released LLMs, e.g., Vicuna, ChatGPT,

Automated Reading Passage Generation with OpenAI's Large Language Model,0.462899,"The widespread usage of computer-based assessments and individualized

process. AIG has been used in test development for some time. Still, the use of
machine learning algorithms has introduced the potential to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the process greatly. The approach presented in

Post-Abstention: Towards Reliably Re-Attempting the Abstained Instances in QA,0.203247,"Despite remarkable progress made in natural language processing, even the
state-of-the-art models often make incorrect predictions. Such predictions
hamper the reliability of systems and limit their widespread adoption in
real-world applications. 'Selective prediction' partly addresses the above

likely to be incorrect. While selective prediction is advantageous, it leaves
us with a pertinent question 'what to do after abstention'. To this end, we
present an explorative study on 'Post-Abstention', a task that allows
re-attempting the abstained instances with the aim of increasing 'coverage' of

the interpolated content feature. Second, we derive multiple groups of
fine-grained flow fields from one pair of updated coarse flows for performing
backward warping on the input frames separately. Combining these two designs

layouts become increasingly chaotic with the growth of forward steps and
layouts in the neighboring steps do not differ too much. Designing such a mild
forward process is however very challenging as layout has both categorical
attributes and ordinal attributes. To tackle the challenge, we summarize three
critical factors for achieving a mild forward process for the layout, i.e.,

A Transformer-based Approach for Arabic Offline Handwritten Text Recognition,0.852553,"Handwriting recognition is a challenging and critical problem in the fields
of pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning a wide
range of domains. In this paper, we focus on the specific issue of recognizing
offline Arabic handwritten text. Existing approaches typically utilize a
combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and
recurrent neural networks for temporal modeling, with connectionist temporal
classification used for text generation. However, these methods suffer from a
lack of parallelization due to the sequential nature of recurrent neural
networks. Furthermore, these models cannot account for linguistic rules,
necessitating the use of an external language model in the post-processing

architectures, namely the Transformer Transducer and the standard
sequence-to-sequence Transformer, and compare their performance in terms of
accuracy and speed. Our approach can model language dependencies and relies
only on the attention mechanism, thereby making it more parallelizable and less

Efficient Adaptive Human-Object Interaction Detection with Concept-guided Memory,0.417567,"Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer the
relationships between a human and an object. Arguably, training supervised

Masked and Adaptive Transformer for Exemplar Based Image Translation,0.44924,"We present a novel framework for exemplar based image translation. Recent
advanced methods for this task mainly focus on establishing cross-domain
semantic correspondence, which sequentially dominates image generation in the
manner of local style control. Unfortunately, cross-domain semantic matching is
challenging; and matching errors ultimately degrade the quality of generated
images. To overcome this challenge, we improve the accuracy of matching on the
one hand, and diminish the role of matching in image generation on the other
hand. To achieve the former, we propose a masked and adaptive transformer (MAT)

feature augmentation. To achieve the latter, we use source features of the
input and global style codes of the exemplar, as supplementary information, for
decoding an image. Besides, we devise a novel contrastive style learning

choice to guide I-JEPA towards producing semantic representations is the
masking strategy; specifically, it is crucial to (a) sample target blocks with
sufficiently large scale (semantic), and to (b) use a sufficiently informative
(spatially distributed) context block. Empirically, when combined with Vision
Transformers, we find I-JEPA to be highly scalable. For instance, we train a

Exploration of Lightweight Single Image Denoising with Transformers and Truly Fair Training,0.135949,"As multimedia content often contains noise from intrinsic defects of digital
devices, image denoising is an important step for high-level vision recognition
tasks. Although several studies have developed the denoising field employing
advanced Transformers, these networks are too momory-intensive for real-world

(LWDN) with Transformers. To handle this, this work provides seven comparative
baseline Transformers for LWDN, serving as a foundation for future research. We
also demonstrate the parts of randomly cropped patches significantly affect the
denoising performances during training. While previous studies have overlooked
this aspect, we aim to train our baseline Transformers in a truly fair manner.
Furthermore, we conduct empirical analyses of various components to determine
the key considerations for constructing LWDN Transformers. Codes are available

FacTool: Factuality Detection in Generative AI -- A Tool Augmented Framework for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Scenarios,0.900563,"The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis
of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual
errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now

models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined
granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence
available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in

Bridging the Gap between Structural and Semantic Similarity in Diverse Planning,0.235938,"Diverse planning is the problem of finding multiple plans for a given problem
specification, which is at the core of many real-world applications. For
example, diverse planning is a critical piece for the efficiency of plan
recognition systems when dealing with noisy and missing observations. Providing
diverse solutions can also benefit situations where constraints are too
expensive or impossible to model. Current diverse planners operate by
generating multiple plans and then applying a selection procedure to extract
diverse solutions using a similarity metric. Generally, current similarity
metrics only consider the structural properties of the given plans. We argue
that this approach is a limitation that sometimes prevents such metrics from
capturing why two plans differ. In this work, we propose two new
domain-independent metrics which are able to capture relevant information on
the difference between two given plans from a domain-dependent viewpoint. We
showcase their utility in various situations where the currently used metrics
fail to capture the similarity between plans, failing to capture some
structural symmetries.",None,-1
ARNOLD: A Benchmark for Language-Grounded Task Learning With Continuous States in Realistic 3D Scenes,0.411352,"Understanding the continuous states of objects is essential for task learning
and planning in the real world. However, most existing task learning benchmarks
assume discrete (e.g., binary) object goal states, which poses challenges for
the learning of complex tasks and transferring learned policy from simulated
environments to the real world. Furthermore, state discretization limits a
robot's ability to follow human instructions based on the grounding of actions
and states. To tackle these challenges, we present ARNOLD, a benchmark that
evaluates language-grounded task learning with continuous states in realistic
3D scenes. ARNOLD is comprised of 8 language-conditioned tasks that involve
understanding object states and learning policies for continuous goals. To
promote language-instructed learning, we provide expert demonstrations with

Getting Sick After Seeing a Doctor? Diagnosing and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Event Temporal Reasoning,0.385201,"Event temporal reasoning aims at identifying the temporal relations between

Multilingual Sentence Transformer as A Multilingual Word Aligner,0.41291,"Multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) have shown their
effectiveness in multilingual word alignment induction. However, these methods

sentence-level embeddings, while the alignment extraction task requires the
more fine-grained word-level embeddings to be language-agnostic. We demonstrate
that the vanilla LaBSE outperforms other mPLMs currently used in the alignment
task, and then propose to finetune LaBSE on parallel corpus for further
improvement. Experiment results on seven language pairs show that our best

AI-Enhanced Intensive Care Unit: Revolutionizing Patient Care with Pervasive Sensing,0.710102,"The intensive care unit (ICU) is a specialized hospital space where
critically ill patients receive intensive care and monitoring. Comprehensive
monitoring is imperative in assessing patients conditions, in particular
acuity, and ultimately the quality of care. However, the extent of patient

identified as the training proceeds using an online clustering approach
operating in an embedding space trained via a prototypical loss to encourage
well-formed clusters. The online nature of ProtoCon allows it to utilise the
label history of the entire dataset in one training cycle to refine labels in
the following cycle without the need to store image embeddings. Hence, it can
seamlessly scale to larger datasets at a low cost. Finally, ProtoCon addresses
the poor training signal in the initial phase of training (due to fewer

Fast and Robust Early-Exiting Framework for Autoregressive Language Models with Synchronized Parallel Decoding,0.678847,"To tackle the high inference latency exhibited by autoregressive language

Our framework enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of
the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens. Furthermore, as

Learning Foresightful Dense Visual Affordance for Deformable Object Manipulation,0.843233,"Understanding and manipulating deformable objects (e.g., ropes and fabrics)

Implicit Chain of Thought Reasoning via Knowledge Distillation,0.279924,"To augment language models with the ability to reason, researchers usually

distilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning,

Framework for Question-Answering in Sanskrit through Automated Construction of Knowledge Graphs,0.193018,"Sanskrit (sa\d{m}sk\d{r}ta) enjoys one of the largest and most varied
literature in the whole world. Extracting the knowledge from it, however, is a
challenging task due to multiple reasons including complexity of the language
and paucity of standard natural language processing tools. In this paper, we
target the problem of building knowledge graphs for particular types of
relationships from sa\d{m}sk\d{r}ta texts. We build a natural language
question-answering system in sa\d{m}sk\d{r}ta that uses the knowledge graph to
answer factoid questions. We design a framework for the overall system and
implement two separate instances of the system on human relationships from
mah\=abh\=arata and r\=am\=aya\d{n}a, and one instance on synonymous
relationships from bh\=avaprak\=a\'sa nigha\d{n}\d{t}u, a technical text from

The Impact of Explanations on Fairness in Human-AI Decision-Making: Protected vs Proxy Features,0.451123,"AI systems have been known to amplify biases in real-world data. Explanations
may help human-AI teams address these biases for fairer decision-making.
Typically, explanations focus on salient input features. If a model is biased
against some protected group, explanations may include features that
demonstrate this bias, but when biases are realized through proxy features, the
relationship between this proxy feature and the protected one may be less clear
to a human. In this work, we study the effect of the presence of protected and
proxy features on participants' perception of model fairness and their ability
to improve demographic parity over an AI alone. Further, we examine how
different treatments -- explanations, model bias disclosure and proxy
correlation disclosure -- affect fairness perception and parity. We find that
explanations help people detect direct but not indirect biases. Additionally,
regardless of bias type, explanations tend to increase agreement with model
biases. Disclosures can help mitigate this effect for indirect biases,
improving both unfairness recognition and decision-making fairness. We hope
that our findings can help guide further research into advancing explanations
in support of fair human-AI decision-making.",None,-1
An Image Processing Pipeline for Autonomous Deep-Space Optical Navigation,0.440582,"A new era of space exploration and exploitation is fast approaching. A
multitude of spacecraft will flow in the future decades under the propulsive
momentum of the new space economy. Yet, the flourishing proliferation of
deep-space assets will make it unsustainable to pilot them from ground with
standard radiometric tracking. The adoption of autonomous navigation
alternatives is crucial to overcoming these limitations. Among these, optical
navigation is an affordable and fully ground-independent approach. Probes can
triangulate their position by observing visible beacons, e.g., planets or
asteroids, by acquiring their line-of-sight in deep space. To do so, developing
efficient and robust image processing algorithms providing information to
navigation filters is a necessary action. This paper proposes an innovative
pipeline for unresolved beacon recognition and line-of-sight extraction from
images for autonomous interplanetary navigation. The developed algorithm
exploits the k-vector method for the non-stellar object identification and
statistical likelihood to detect whether any beacon projection is visible in
the image. Statistical results show that the accuracy in detecting the planet
position projection is independent of the spacecraft position uncertainty.
Whereas, the planet detection success rate is higher than 95% when the
spacecraft position is known with a 3sigma accuracy up to 10^5 km.",None,-1
Polynomial Neural Fields for Subband Decomposition and Manipulation,0.346051,"Neural fields have emerged as a new paradigm for representing signals, thanks
to their ability to do it compactly while being easy to optimize. In most
applications, however, neural fields are treated like black boxes, which
precludes many signal manipulation tasks. In this paper, we propose a new class
of neural fields called polynomial neural fields (PNFs). The key advantage of a
PNF is that it can represent a signal as a composition of a number of
manipulable and interpretable components without losing the merits of neural
fields representation. We develop a general theoretical framework to analyze
and design PNFs. We use this framework to design Fourier PNFs, which match
state-of-the-art performance in signal representation tasks that use neural
fields. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that Fourier PNFs enable signal

Causality Analysis for Evaluating the Security of Large Language Models,0.0470595,"Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and Llama2 are increasingly adopted
in many safety-critical applications. Their security is thus essential. Even
with considerable efforts spent on reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), recent studies have shown that LLMs are still subject to attacks such
as adversarial perturbation and Trojan attacks. Further research is thus needed
to evaluate their security and/or understand the lack of it. In this work, we
propose a framework for conducting light-weight causality-analysis of LLMs at
the token, layer, and neuron level. We applied our framework to open-source
LLMs such as Llama2 and Vicuna and had multiple interesting discoveries. Based
on a layer-level causality analysis, we show that RLHF has the effect of
overfitting a model to harmful prompts. It implies that such security can be
easily overcome by `unusual' harmful prompts. As evidence, we propose an
adversarial perturbation method that achieves 100\% attack success rate on the
red-teaming tasks of the Trojan Detection Competition 2023. Furthermore, we
show the existence of one mysterious neuron in both Llama2 and Vicuna that has
an unreasonably high causal effect on the output. While we are uncertain on why
such a neuron exists, we show that it is possible to conduct a ``Trojan''
attack targeting that particular neuron to completely cripple the LLM, i.e., we
can generate transferable suffixes to prompts that frequently make the LLM
produce meaningless responses.",None,-1
Gotta: Generative Few-shot Question Answering by Prompt-based Cloze Data Augmentation,0.410868,"Few-shot question answering (QA) aims at precisely discovering answers to a
set of questions from context passages while only a few training samples are
available. Although existing studies have made some progress and can usually
achieve proper results, they suffer from understanding deep semantics for
reasoning out the questions. In this paper, we develop Gotta, a Generative
prOmpT-based daTa Augmentation framework to mitigate the challenge above.
Inspired by the human reasoning process, we propose to integrate the cloze task
to enhance few-shot QA learning. Following the recent success of prompt-tuning,
we present the cloze task in the same format as the main QA task, allowing the
model to learn both tasks seamlessly together to fully take advantage of the
power of prompt-tuning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines,
validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task,
which not only fine-tunes language models but also learns to guide reasoning in
QA tasks. Further analysis shows that the prompt-based loss incorporates the
auxiliary task better than the multi-task loss, highlighting the strength of
prompt-tuning on the few-shot QA task.",None,-1
Layout-guided Indoor Panorama Inpainting with Plane-aware Normalization,0.455341,"We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for indoor panoramic image
inpainting. Although previous inpainting methods have shown impressive
performance on natural perspective images, most fail to handle panoramic
images, particularly indoor scenes, which usually contain complex structure and
texture content. To achieve better inpainting quality, we propose to exploit
both the global and local context of indoor panorama during the inpainting
process. Specifically, we take the low-level layout edges estimated from the
input panorama as a prior to guide the inpainting model for recovering the
global indoor structure. A plane-aware normalization module is employed to
embed plane-wise style features derived from the layout into the generator,
encouraging local texture restoration from adjacent room structures (i.e.,

Legal Syllogism Prompting: Teaching Large Language Models for Legal Judgment Prediction,0.99957,"Legal syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning commonly used by legal
professionals to analyze cases. In this paper, we propose legal syllogism
prompting (LoT), a simple prompting method to teach large language models

syllogism the major premise is law, the minor premise is the fact, and the
conclusion is judgment. Then the models can produce a syllogism reasoning of
the case and give the judgment without any learning, fine-tuning, or examples.
On CAIL2018, a Chinese criminal case dataset, we performed zero-shot judgment
prediction experiments with GPT-3 models. Our results show that LLMs with LoT
achieve better performance than the baseline and chain of thought prompting,
the state-of-art prompting method on diverse reasoning tasks. LoT enables the
model to concentrate on the key information relevant to the judgment and to
correctly understand the legal meaning of acts, as compared to other methods.

Exploring XAI for the Arts: Explaining Latent Space in Generative Music,0.505282,"Explainable AI has the potential to support more interactive and fluid
co-creative AI systems which can creatively collaborate with people. To do
this, creative AI models need to be amenable to debugging by offering
eXplainable AI (XAI) features which are inspectable, understandable, and
modifiable. However, currently there is very little XAI for the arts. In this
work, we demonstrate how a latent variable model for music generation can be
made more explainable; specifically we extend MeasureVAE which generates
measures of music. We increase the explainability of the model by: i) using
latent space regularisation to force some specific dimensions of the latent
space to map to meaningful musical attributes, ii) providing a user interface
feedback loop to allow people to adjust dimensions of the latent space and
observe the results of these changes in real-time, iii) providing a
visualisation of the musical attributes in the latent space to help people
understand and predict the effect of changes to latent space dimensions. We
suggest that in doing so we bridge the gap between the latent space and the
generated musical outcomes in a meaningful way which makes the model and its
outputs more explainable and more debuggable.",None,-1
Contextual Vision Transformers for Robust Representation Learning,0.393507,"We introduce Contextual Vision Transformers (ContextViT), a method designed
to generate robust image representations for datasets experiencing shifts in
latent factors across various groups. Derived from the concept of in-context
learning, ContextViT incorporates an additional context token to encapsulate
group-specific information. This integration allows the model to adjust the
image representation in accordance with the group-specific context.
Specifically, for a given input image, ContextViT maps images with identical
group membership into this context token, which is appended to the input image
tokens. Additionally, we introduce a context inference network to predict such
tokens on-the-fly, given a batch of samples from the group. This enables
ContextViT to adapt to new testing distributions during inference time. We
demonstrate the efficacy of ContextViT across a wide range of applications. In
supervised fine-tuning, we show that augmenting pre-trained ViTs with our
proposed context conditioning mechanism results in consistent improvements in
out-of-distribution generalization on iWildCam and FMoW. We also investigate
self-supervised representation learning with ContextViT. Our experiments on the

Image Super-Resolution using Efficient Striped Window Transformer,0.306799,"Transformers have achieved remarkable results in single-image

introduce a striped window mechanism to model long-term dependencies more
efficiently. To fully exploit the potential of the ESWT, we propose a novel
flexible window training strategy that can improve the performance of the ESWT
without additional cost. Extensive experiments show that ESWT outperforms
state-of-the-art LSR transformers, and achieves a better trade-off between
model performance and complexity. The ESWT requires fewer parameters, incurs
faster inference, smaller FLOPs, and less memory consumption, making it a
promising solution for LSR.",None,-1
Optimizing Data Shapley Interaction Calculation from O(2^n) to O(t n^2) for KNN models,0.19746,"With the rapid growth of data availability and usage, quantifying the added

Hallucination is the last thing you need,0.647517,"The legal profession necessitates a multidimensional approach that involves
synthesizing an in-depth comprehension of a legal issue with insightful
commentary based on personal experience, combined with a comprehensive

presents major obstacles in replicating this, as current models struggle to
integrate and navigate such a complex interplay of understanding, experience,

understanding and experience, which reflect the aggregate of various subjective
views on similar topics, this often deflects the model's attention from the
crucial legal facts, thereby resulting in hallucination. Hence, this paper
delves into the feasibility of three independent LLMs, each focused on

Exploring Invariant Representation for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,0.738437,"Cross-spectral person re-identification, which aims to associate identities
to pedestrians across different spectra, faces a main challenge of the modality

mining network (RFM). In particular, we observe that the reflective intensity
of the same surface in photos shot in different wavelengths could be
transformed using a linear model. Besides, we show the variable linear factor
across the different surfaces is the main culprit which initiates the modality
discrepancy. We integrate such a reflection observation into an image-level
data augmentation by proposing the linear transformation generator (LTG).
Moreover, at the feature level, we introduce a cross-center loss to explore a
more compact intra-class distribution and modality-aware spatial attention to
take advantage of textured regions more efficiently. Experiment results on two

Backdoor Defense via Deconfounded Representation Learning,0.763817,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are recently shown to be vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a
few poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have
been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not
clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from
poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model
the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts
as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images
and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the
causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD),
to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification.
Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the
confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired
causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding
representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise
re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is
effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in
predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist

Instant Continual Learning of Neural Radiance Fields,0.349591,"Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have emerged as an effective method for
novel-view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, conventional

optimization. This assumption may be prohibitive in continual learning
scenarios, where new data is acquired in a sequential manner and a continuous
update of the NeRF is desired, as in automotive or remote sensing applications.
When naively trained in such a continual setting, traditional scene
representation frameworks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where previously
learned knowledge is corrupted after training on new data. Prior works in
alleviating forgetting with NeRFs suffer from low reconstruction quality and
high latency, making them impractical for real-world application. We propose a
continual learning framework for training NeRFs that leverages replay-based

method outperforms previous methods in reconstruction quality when trained in a
continual setting, while having the additional benefit of being an order of
magnitude faster.",None,-1

censored training. To evaluate artistic style removal, we conduct experiments
erasing five modern artists from the network and conduct a user study to assess
the human perception of the removed styles. Unlike previous methods, our

Better Diffusion Models Further Improve Adversarial Training,0.999596,"It has been recognized that the data generated by the denoising diffusion

While employing the latter for training can be resource-intensive, recent work

A recommender for the management of chronic pain in patients undergoing spinal cord stimulation,0.426041,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a therapeutic approach used for the

ReMaX: Relaxing for Better Training on Efficient Panoptic Segmentation,0.360195,"This paper presents a new mechanism to facilitate the training of mask
transformers for efficient panoptic segmentation, democratizing its deployment.
We observe that due to its high complexity, the training objective of panoptic
segmentation will inevitably lead to much higher false positive penalization.
Such unbalanced loss makes the training process of the end-to-end
mask-transformer based architectures difficult, especially for efficient
models. In this paper, we present ReMaX that adds relaxation to mask
predictions and class predictions during training for panoptic segmentation. We
demonstrate that via these simple relaxation techniques during training, our
model can be consistently improved by a clear margin \textbf{without} any extra
computational cost on inference. By combining our method with efficient
backbones like MobileNetV3-Small, our method achieves new state-of-the-art
results for efficient panoptic segmentation on COCO, ADE20K and Cityscapes.

Unified Mask Embedding and Correspondence Learning for Self-Supervised Video Segmentation,0.483877,"The objective of this paper is self-supervised learning of video object
segmentation. We develop a unified framework which simultaneously models
cross-frame dense correspondence for locally discriminative feature learning
and embeds object-level context for target-mask decoding. As a result, it is
able to directly learn to perform mask-guided sequential segmentation from
unlabeled videos, in contrast to previous efforts usually relying on an oblique
solution - cheaply ""copying"" labels according to pixel-wise correlations.
Concretely, our algorithm alternates between i) clustering video pixels for
creating pseudo segmentation labels ex nihilo; and ii) utilizing the pseudo
labels to learn mask encoding and decoding for VOS. Unsupervised correspondence
learning is further incorporated into this self-taught, mask embedding scheme,
so as to ensure the generic nature of the learnt representation and avoid
cluster degeneracy. Our algorithm sets state-of-the-arts on two standard
benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS), narrowing the gap between self- and
fully-supervised VOS, in terms of both performance and network architecture
design.",None,-1
Distributed Marker Representation for Ambiguous Discourse Markers and Entangled Relations,0.55298,"Discourse analysis is an important task because it models intrinsic semantic
structures between sentences in a document. Discourse markers are natural
representations of discourse in our daily language. One challenge is that the
markers as well as pre-defined and human-labeled discourse relations can be
ambiguous when describing the semantics between sentences. We believe that a
better approach is to use a contextual-dependent distribution over the markers
to express discourse information. In this work, we propose to learn a
Distributed Marker Representation (DMR) by utilizing the (potentially)
unlimited discourse marker data with a latent discourse sense, thereby bridging
markers with sentence pairs. Such representations can be learned automatically
from data without supervision, and in turn provide insights into the data
itself. Experiments show the SOTA performance of our DMR on the implicit
discourse relation recognition task and strong interpretability. Our method
also offers a valuable tool to understand complex ambiguity and entanglement
among discourse markers and manually defined discourse relations.",None,-1
RenewNAT: Renewing Potential Translation for Non-Autoregressive Transformer,0.60886,"Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) models are proposed to
accelerate the inference process while maintaining relatively high performance.
However, existing NAT models are difficult to achieve the desired
efficiency-quality trade-off. For one thing, fully NAT models with efficient
inference perform inferior to their autoregressive counterparts. For another,
iterative NAT models can, though, achieve comparable performance while
diminishing the advantage of speed. In this paper, we propose RenewNAT, a
flexible framework with high efficiency and effectiveness, to incorporate the
merits of fully and iterative NAT models. RenewNAT first generates the
potential translation results and then renews them in a single pass. It can
achieve significant performance improvements at the same expense as traditional
NAT models (without introducing additional model parameters and decoding
latency). Experimental results on various translation benchmarks (e.g.,
\textbf{4} WMT) show that our framework consistently improves the performance
of strong fully NAT methods (e.g., GLAT and DSLP) without additional speed

FECANet: Boosting Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation with Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware Network,0.878276,"Few-shot semantic segmentation is the task of learning to locate each pixel
of the novel class in the query image with only a few annotated support images.
The current correlation-based methods construct pair-wise feature correlations
to establish the many-to-many matching because the typical prototype-based
approaches cannot learn fine-grained correspondence relations. However, the
existing methods still suffer from the noise contained in naive correlations
and the lack of context semantic information in correlations. To alleviate
these problems mentioned above, we propose a Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware
Network (FECANet). Specifically, a feature enhancement module is proposed to
suppress the matching noise caused by inter-class local similarity and enhance
the intra-class relevance in the naive correlation. In addition, we propose a
novel correlation reconstruction module that encodes extra correspondence
relations between foreground and background and multi-scale context semantic
features, significantly boosting the encoder to capture a reliable matching

Steerable Equivariant Representation Learning,0.104248,"Pre-trained deep image representations are useful for post-training tasks
such as classification through transfer learning, image retrieval, and object
detection. Data augmentations are a crucial aspect of pre-training robust
representations in both supervised and self-supervised settings. Data
augmentations explicitly or implicitly promote invariance in the embedding
space to the input image transformations. This invariance reduces
generalization to those downstream tasks which rely on sensitivity to these
particular data augmentations. In this paper, we propose a method of learning
representations that are instead equivariant to data augmentations. We achieve
this equivariance through the use of steerable representations. Our
representations can be manipulated directly in embedding space via learned
linear maps. We demonstrate that our resulting steerable and equivariant
representations lead to better performance on transfer learning and robustness:
e.g. we improve linear probe top-1 accuracy by between 1% to 3% for transfer;
and ImageNet-C accuracy by upto 3.4%. We further show that the steerability of
our representations provides significant speedup (nearly 50x) for test-time

Diverse Embedding Expansion Network and Low-Light Cross-Modality Benchmark for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification,0.998303,"For the visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) task, one of the
major challenges is the modality gaps between visible (VIS) and infrared (IR)

existing VIReID datasets are captured under sufficient illumination without
significant light changes. Thus, we provide a low-light cross-modality (LLCM)

Break It Down: Evidence for Structural Compositionality in Neural Networks,0.718099,"Though modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance in both
vision and language tasks, we know little about the functions that they
implement. One possibility is that neural networks implicitly break down
complex tasks into subroutines, implement modular solutions to these
subroutines, and compose them into an overall solution to a task - a property
we term structural compositionality. Another possibility is that they may
simply learn to match new inputs to learned templates, eliding task
decomposition entirely. Here, we leverage model pruning techniques to
investigate this question in both vision and language across a variety of
architectures, tasks, and pretraining regimens. Our results demonstrate that
models often implement solutions to subroutines via modular subnetworks, which
can be ablated while maintaining the functionality of other subnetworks. This
suggests that neural networks may be able to learn compositionality, obviating
the need for specialized symbolic mechanisms.",None,-1

Balancing Privacy and Progress in Artificial Intelligence: Anonymization in Histopathology for Biomedical Research and Education,0.329497,"The advancement of biomedical research heavily relies on access to large
amounts of medical data. In the case of histopathology, Whole Slide Images

Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Digital Pathology (DP).
Transferring medical data ""as open as possible"" enhances the usability of the
data for secondary purposes but poses a risk to patient privacy. At the same
time, existing regulations push towards keeping medical data ""as closed as
necessary"" to avoid re-identification risks. Generally, these legal regulations
require the removal of sensitive data but do not consider the possibility of
data linkage attacks due to modern image-matching algorithms. In addition, the
lack of standardization in DP makes it harder to establish a single solution

Late Breaking Results: Scalable and Efficient Hyperdimensional Computing for Network Intrusion Detection,0.37337,"Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical challenge for the industry. With the

Normalizing Flow based Feature Synthesis for Outlier-Aware Object Detection,0.791661,"Real-world deployment of reliable object detectors is crucial for
applications such as autonomous driving. However, general-purpose object
detectors like Faster R-CNN are prone to providing overconfident predictions
for outlier objects. Recent outlier-aware object detection approaches estimate
the density of instance-wide features with class-conditional Gaussians and
train on synthesized outlier features from their low-likelihood regions.
However, this strategy does not guarantee that the synthesized outlier features
will have a low likelihood according to the other class-conditional Gaussians.
We propose a novel outlier-aware object detection framework that distinguishes
outliers from inlier objects by learning the joint data distribution of all
inlier classes with an invertible normalizing flow. The appropriate sampling of
the flow model ensures that the synthesized outliers have a lower likelihood
than inliers of all object classes, thereby modeling a better decision boundary

TaBIIC: Taxonomy Building through Iterative and Interactive Clustering,0.114336,"Building taxonomies is often a significant part of building an ontology, and
many attempts have been made to automate the creation of such taxonomies from

formal concept analysis) or that their extension can be built from grouping
data objects based on similarity (clustering). In both cases, the process leads
to an automatically constructed structure, which can either be too coarse and
lacking in definition, or too fined-grained and detailed, therefore requiring
to be refined into the desired taxonomy. In this paper, we explore a method
that takes inspiration from both approaches in an iterative and interactive

approaches to representing a pictogram for prediction: as a word (using
pictogram captions), as a concept (using a dictionary definition), and as a set
of synonyms (using related terms). We also evaluated the usage of images for
pictogram prediction. The results demonstrate that using embeddings computed
from the pictograms' caption, synonyms, or definitions have a similar

Structured State Space Models for Multiple Instance Learning in Digital Pathology,0.859252,"Multiple instance learning is an ideal mode of analysis for histopathology
data, where vast whole slide images are typically annotated with a single

Although powerful compression algorithms, such as deep pre-trained neural

arising from whole slide images remain excessively long, routinely containing
tens of thousands of patches. Structured state space models are an emerging
alternative for sequence modelling, specifically designed for the efficient

Securing Deep Generative Models with Universal Adversarial Signature,0.10467,"Recent advances in deep generative models have led to the development of
methods capable of synthesizing high-quality, realistic images. These models
pose threats to society due to their potential misuse. Prior research attempted
to mitigate these threats by detecting generated images, but the varying traces
left by different generative models make it challenging to create a universal
detector capable of generalizing to new, unseen generative models. In this
paper, we propose to inject a universal adversarial signature into an arbitrary
pre-trained generative model, in order to make its generated contents more
detectable and traceable. First, the imperceptible optimal signature for each
image can be found by a signature injector through adversarial training.
Subsequently, the signature can be incorporated into an arbitrary generator by
fine-tuning it with the images processed by the signature injector. In this
way, the detector corresponding to the signature can be reused for any
fine-tuned generator for tracking the generator identity. The proposed method
is validated on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets with various state-of-the-art
generative models, consistently showing a promising detection rate. Code will

Balanced Energy Regularization Loss for Out-of-distribution Detection,0.746105,"In the field of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a previous method that
use auxiliary data as OOD data has shown promising performance. However, the
method provides an equal loss to all auxiliary data to differentiate them from

utilizes class-wise different prior probabilities for auxiliary data to address
the class imbalance in OOD data. The main concept is to regularize auxiliary

Adaptive Texture Filtering for Single-Domain Generalized Segmentation,0.0500268,"Domain generalization in semantic segmentation aims to alleviate the

texture bank, and training them can be time-consuming. In contrast to importing
textures arbitrarily or augmenting styles randomly, we focus on the single
source domain itself to achieve generalization. In this paper, we present a
novel adaptive texture filtering mechanism to suppress the influence of texture
without using augmentation, thus eliminating the interference of
domain-specific features. Further, we design a hierarchical guidance
generalization network equipped with structure-guided enhancement modules,

Improving Transformer-based Image Matching by Cascaded Capturing Spatially Informative Keypoints,0.355432,"Learning robust local image feature matching is a fundamental low-level
vision task, which has been widely explored in the past few years. Recently,
detector-free local feature matchers based on transformers have shown promising
results, which largely outperform pure Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based

limited to the center of source views' coarse patches, because of the costly
attention learning. In this work, we rethink this issue and find that such
matching formulation degrades pose estimation, especially for low-resolution

feature Matching TRansformer (CasMTR), to efficiently learn dense feature
correlations, which allows us to choose more reliable matching pairs for the
relative pose estimation. Instead of re-training a new detector, we use a
simple yet effective Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-process to filter

Hallucination Improves the Performance of Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning,0.877504,"Contrastive learning models based on Siamese structure have demonstrated
remarkable performance in self-supervised learning. Such a success of
contrastive learning relies on two conditions, a sufficient number of positive
pairs and adequate variations between them. If the conditions are not met,
these frameworks will lack semantic contrast and be fragile on overfitting. To
address these two issues, we propose Hallucinator that could efficiently
generate additional positive samples for further contrast. The Hallucinator is
differentiable and creates new data in the feature space. Thus, it is optimized
directly with the pre-training task and introduces nearly negligible
computation. Moreover, we reduce the mutual information of hallucinated pairs
and smooth them through non-linear operations. This process helps avoid
over-confident contrastive learning models during the training and achieves
more transformation-invariant feature embeddings. Remarkably, we empirically
prove that the proposed Hallucinator generalizes well to various contrastive
learning models, including MoCoV1&V2, SimCLR and SimSiam. Under the linear
classification protocol, a stable accuracy gain is achieved, ranging from 0.3%

Shielded Representations: Protecting Sensitive Attributes Through Iterative Gradient-Based Projection,0.679431,"Natural language processing models tend to learn and encode social biases

representation on a hypersurface, such that the classifiers become oblivious to
the target attribute. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the task

Interactive Explanations by Conflict Resolution via Argumentative Exchanges,0.252781,"As the field of explainable AI (XAI) is maturing, calls for interactive
explanations for (the outputs of) AI models are growing, but the
state-of-the-art predominantly focuses on static explanations. In this paper,
we focus instead on interactive explanations framed as conflict resolution
between agents (i.e. AI models and/or humans) by leveraging on computational
argumentation. Specifically, we define Argumentative eXchanges (AXs) for
dynamically sharing, in multi-agent systems, information harboured in
individual agents' quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks towards
resolving conflicts amongst the agents. We then deploy AXs in the XAI setting
in which a machine and a human interact about the machine's predictions. We
identify and assess several theoretical properties characterising AXs that are
suitable for XAI. Finally, we instantiate AXs for XAI by defining various agent
behaviours, e.g. capturing counterfactual patterns of reasoning in machines and
highlighting the effects of cognitive biases in humans. We show experimentally
(in a simulated environment) the comparative advantages of these behaviours in
terms of conflict resolution, and show that the strongest argument may not
always be the most effective.",None,-1
Towards Medical Artificial General Intelligence via Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Pretraining,0.346755,"Medical artificial general intelligence (MAGI) enables one foundation model
to solve different medical tasks, which is very practical in the medical
domain. It can significantly reduce the requirement of large amounts of
task-specific data by sufficiently sharing medical knowledge among different
tasks. However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable
models with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to
develop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new
paradigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR). In
MOTOR, we combine two kinds of basic medical knowledge, i.e., general and
specific knowledge, in a complementary manner to boost the general pretraining
process. As a result, the foundation model with comprehensive basic knowledge
can learn compact representations from pretraining radiographic data for better
cross-modal alignment. MOTOR unifies the understanding and generation, which
are two kinds of core intelligence of an AI system, into a single medical
foundation model, to flexibly handle more diverse medical tasks. To enable a
comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a
medical multimodal benchmark including a wide range of downstream tasks, such
as chest x-ray report generation and medical visual question answering.
Extensive experiments on our benchmark show that MOTOR obtains promising
results through simple task-oriented adaptation. The visualization shows that
the injected knowledge successfully highlights key information in the medical
data, demonstrating the excellent interpretability of MOTOR. Our MOTOR
successfully mimics the human practice of fulfilling a ""medical student"" to
accelerate the process of becoming a ""specialist"". We believe that our work
makes a significant stride in realizing MAGI.",None,-1
A Cross-Linguistic Pressure for Uniform Information Density in Word Order,0.540743,"While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and word
order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic
statistical patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort
to identify these pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual
word orders. Yet one functional pressure has been overlooked in such
investigations: the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which holds
that information should be spread evenly throughout an utterance. Here, we ask
whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order patterns
cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test whether
real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders.
In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i)
among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than
reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual
orders consistently exceed the uniformity of real orders. These findings are
compatible with a pressure for information uniformity in the development and
usage of natural languages.",None,-1
Enhanced Multimodal Representation Learning with Cross-modal KD,0.242593,"This paper explores the tasks of leveraging auxiliary modalities which are
only available at training to enhance multimodal representation learning
through cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (KD). The widely adopted mutual
information maximization-based objective leads to a short-cut solution of the
weak teacher, i.e., achieving the maximum mutual information by simply making
the teacher model as weak as the student model. To prevent such a weak
solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual
information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to
narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further
propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student.
Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning

Fine-grained Affordance Annotation for Egocentric Hand-Object Interaction Videos,0.870795,"Object affordance is an important concept in hand-object interaction,
providing information on action possibilities based on human motor capacity and
objects' physical property thus benefiting tasks such as action anticipation
and robot imitation learning. However, the definition of affordance in existing
datasets often: 1) mix up affordance with object functionality; 2) confuse
affordance with goal-related action; and 3) ignore human motor capacity. This
paper proposes an efficient annotation scheme to address these issues by
combining goal-irrelevant motor actions and grasp types as affordance labels
and introducing the concept of mechanical action to represent the action
possibilities between two objects. We provide new annotations by applying this
scheme to the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset and test our annotation with tasks such as
affordance recognition, hand-object interaction hotspots prediction, and
cross-domain evaluation of affordance. The results show that models trained

fine-grained interaction possibilities on objects, and generalize through
different domains.",None,-1
Multilingual Controllable Transformer-Based Lexical Simplification,0.144759,"Text is by far the most ubiquitous source of knowledge and information and

Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?,0.493521,"Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged
as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide
training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on
decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE
makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to
adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized
training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize
global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy
exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent
reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange
among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for
execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to
seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To
further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning
mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one
without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on
StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks

with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly

Enriching language models with graph-based context information to better understand textual data,0.080906,"A considerable number of texts encountered daily are somehow connected with
each other. For example, Wikipedia articles refer to other articles via

a graph-like structure can represent existing connections and be seen as
capturing the ""context"" of the texts. The question thus arises if extracting
and integrating such context information into a language model might help
facilitate a better automated understanding of the text. In this study, we
experimentally demonstrate that incorporating graph-based contextualization

Diverse Motion In-betweening with Dual Posture Stitching,0.192759,"In-betweening is a technique for generating transitions given initial and

two frames (only the first and last). To cope with this challenging scenario,
we implement our bi-directional scheme which generates forward and backward
transitions from the start and end frames with two adversarial autoregressive
networks, and stitches them in the middle of the transition where there is no
strict ground truth. The autoregressive networks based on conditional
variational autoencoders (CVAE) are optimized by searching for a pair of

Towards Fair Patient-Trial Matching via Patient-Criterion Level Fairness Constraint,0.627672,"Clinical trials are indispensable in developing new treatments, but they face
obstacles in patient recruitment and retention, hindering the enrollment of
necessary participants. To tackle these challenges, deep learning frameworks
have been created to match patients to trials. These frameworks calculate the
similarity between patients and clinical trial eligibility criteria,
considering the discrepancy between inclusion and exclusion criteria. Recent
studies have shown that these frameworks outperform earlier approaches.
However, deep learning models may raise fairness issues in patient-trial
matching when certain sensitive groups of individuals are underrepresented in
clinical trials, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data and potential harm.
To tackle the issue of fairness, this work proposes a fair patient-trial
matching framework by generating a patient-criterion level fairness constraint.
The proposed framework considers the inconsistency between the embedding of
inclusion and exclusion criteria among patients of different sensitive groups.
The experimental results on real-world patient-trial and patient-criterion

Contrastive Multi-Task Dense Prediction,0.371477,"This paper targets the problem of multi-task dense prediction which aims to
achieve simultaneous learning and inference on a bunch of multiple dense
prediction tasks in a single framework. A core objective in design is how to
effectively model cross-task interactions to achieve a comprehensive
improvement on different tasks based on their inherent complementarity and
consistency. Existing works typically design extra expensive distillation
modules to perform explicit interaction computations among different
task-specific features in both training and inference, bringing difficulty in
adaptation for different task sets, and reducing efficiency due to clearly
increased size of multi-task models. In contrast, we introduce feature-wise

Auto MC-Reward: Automated Dense Reward Design with Large Language Models for Minecraft,0.33202,"Many reinforcement learning environments (e.g., Minecraft) provide only
sparse rewards that indicate task completion or failure with binary values. The

according to collected trajectories. In the next round, Reward Designer will
further refine and iterate the dense reward function based on feedback.

Non-Contrastive Unsupervised Learning of Physiological Signals from Video,0.917498,"Subtle periodic signals such as blood volume pulse and respiration can be

An Expression Tree Decoding Strategy for Mathematical Equation Generation,0.502986,"Generating mathematical equations from natural language requires an accurate

However, each expression represents a solving step, and there naturally exist
parallel or dependent relations between these steps, which are ignored by
current sequential methods. Therefore, we integrate tree structure into the
expression-level generation and advocate an expression tree decoding strategy.
To generate a tree with expression as its node, we employ a layer-wise parallel
decoding strategy: we decode multiple independent expressions (leaf nodes) in
parallel at each layer and repeat parallel decoding layer by layer to
sequentially generate these parent node expressions that depend on others.
Besides, a bipartite matching algorithm is adopted to align multiple

Improving Language Models via Plug-and-Play Retrieval Feedback,0.725941,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various

When Do Annotator Demographics Matter? Measuring the Influence of Annotator Demographics with the POPQUORN Dataset,0.272108,"Annotators are not fungible. Their demographics, life experiences, and
backgrounds all contribute to how they label data. However, NLP has only
recently considered how annotator identity might influence their decisions.
Here, we present POPQUORN (the POtato-Prolific dataset for QUestion-Answering,
Offensiveness, text Rewriting, and politeness rating with demographic Nuance).
POPQUORN contains 45,000 annotations from 1,484 annotators, drawn from a
representative sample regarding sex, age, and race as the US population.
Through a series of analyses, we show that annotators' background plays a
significant role in their judgments. Further, our work shows that backgrounds
not previously considered in NLP (e.g., education), are meaningful and should
be considered. Our study suggests that understanding the background of

Explore the difficulty of words and its influential attributes based on the Wordle game,0.681788,"We adopt the distribution and expectation of guessing times in game Wordle as

distribution of guessing times for each word with Markov which generates the
associativity of words. Afterwards, we take advantage of lasso regression to
predict the deviation of guessing times expectation and quadratic programming
to obtain the correction of the original distribution.To predict the difficulty
levels, we first use hierarchical clustering to classify the difficulty levels
based on the expectation of guessing times. Afterwards we downscale the

CCLAP: Controllable Chinese Landscape Painting Generation via Latent Diffusion Model,0.750882,"With the development of deep generative models, recent years have seen great
success of Chinese landscape painting generation. However, few works focus on
controllable Chinese landscape painting generation due to the lack of data and

it consists of two cascaded modules, i.e., content generator and style
aggregator. The content generator module guarantees the content of generated
paintings specific to the input text. While the style aggregator module is to
generate paintings of a style corresponding to a reference image. Moreover, a
new dataset of Chinese landscape paintings named CLAP is collected for

A Unified Generative Approach to Product Attribute-Value Identification,0.956841,"Product attribute-value identification (PAVI) has been studied to link
products on e-commerce sites with their attribute values (e.g., <Material,

multi-attribute values, and canonicalized values, which are only partly
addressed in existing extraction- and classification-based approaches.
Motivated by this, we explore a generative approach to the PAVI task. We
finetune a pre-trained generative model, T5, to decode a set of attribute-value
pairs as a target sequence from the given product text. Since the attribute
value pairs are unordered set elements, how to linearize them will matter; we,

SpotEM: Efficient Video Search for Episodic Memory,0.796142,"The goal in episodic memory (EM) is to search a long egocentric video to

the context of rooms, objects, and interactions that suggest where to look; and
3) distillation losses that address the optimization issues arising from

WYWEB: A NLP Evaluation Benchmark For Classical Chinese,0.649107,"To fully evaluate the overall performance of different NLP models in a given

Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation for Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation,0.588244,"Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and precisely segment objects
of unseen categories without any training samples. Since the model is trained
on seen categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all
the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between
background and novel objects that have never shown up in training. These two
challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance
segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and
dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D$^2$Zero with
Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the
performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing
utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in
visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct
dynamical classification based on the input image. Background disambiguation
produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel
objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we significantly

aggregation operations. This paper investigates the contributions and
deficiencies of attention mechanisms on the performance of time series
forecasting. Specifically, we find that (1) attention is not necessary for
capturing temporal dependencies, (2) the entanglement and redundancy in the
capture of temporal and channel interaction affect the forecasting performance,
and (3) it is important to model the mapping between the input and the
prediction sequence. To this end, we propose MTS-Mixers, which use two

High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle,0.932976,"Clustering aims to group unlabelled samples based on their similarities. It
has become a significant tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data.
However, most of the clustering methods merely generate pseudo labels and thus
are unable to simultaneously present the similarities between different
clusters and outliers. This paper proposes a new framework called
High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle (HCHC) to solve the above
problems. First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure in one
objective function for deep clustering, improving the labels as relative
probabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while
keeping the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different
clusters are sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster
similarities and mapped on the circumference of a circle. Finally, a sample
with a higher probability of a cluster will be mapped closer to the
corresponding anchor. In this way, our framework allows us to appreciate three
aspects visually and simultaneously - clusters (formed by samples with high
probabilities), cluster similarities (represented as circular distances), and
outliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters). The experiments
illustrate the superiority of HCHC.",None,-1
Constraint and Union for Partially-Supervised Temporal Sentence Grounding,0.596228,"Temporal sentence grounding aims to detect the event timestamps described by
the natural language query from given untrimmed videos. The existing
fully-supervised setting achieves great performance but requires expensive

paper introduces an intermediate partially-supervised setting, i.e., only
short-clip or even single-frame labels are available during training. To take
full advantage of partial labels, we propose a novel quadruple constraint
pipeline to comprehensively shape event-query aligned representations, covering
intra- and inter-samples, uni- and multi-modalities. The former raises
intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separability; while the latter
enables event-background separation and event-query gather. To achieve more
powerful performance with explicit grounding optimization, we further introduce
a partial-full union framework, i.e., bridging with an additional

the strongest baseline. Its topics are also interpretable, dispensing with
ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and

Characterization and Learning of Causal Graphs with Small Conditioning Sets,0.0437546,"Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms learn part of the causal graph
structure by systematically testing conditional independences observed in the
data. These algorithms, such as the PC algorithm and its variants, rely on
graphical characterizations of the so-called equivalence class of causal graphs
proposed by Pearl. However, constraint-based causal discovery algorithms
struggle when data is limited since conditional independence tests quickly lose
their statistical power, especially when the conditioning set is large. To
address this, we propose using conditional independence tests where the size of
the conditioning set is upper bounded by some integer $k$ for robust causal
discovery. The existing graphical characterizations of the equivalence classes
of causal graphs are not applicable when we cannot leverage all the conditional
independence statements. We first define the notion of $k$-Markov equivalence:
Two causal graphs are $k$-Markov equivalent if they entail the same conditional
independence constraints where the conditioning set size is upper bounded by
$k$. We propose a novel representation that allows us to graphically
characterize $k$-Markov equivalence between two causal graphs. We propose a
sound constraint-based algorithm called the $k$-PC algorithm for learning this
equivalence class. Finally, we conduct synthetic, and semi-synthetic
experiments to demonstrate that the $k$-PC algorithm enables more robust causal
discovery in the small sample regime compared to the baseline algorithms.",None,-1

Adaptive Superpixel for Active Learning in Semantic Segmentation,0.226328,"Learning semantic segmentation requires pixel-wise annotations, which can be
time-consuming and expensive. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a
superpixel-based active learning (AL) framework, which collects a dominant
label per superpixel instead. To be specific, it consists of adaptive
superpixel and sieving mechanisms, fully dedicated to AL. At each round of AL,
we adaptively merge neighboring pixels of similar learned features into
superpixels. We then query a selected subset of these superpixels using an
acquisition function assuming no uniform superpixel size. This approach is more
efficient than existing methods, which rely only on innate features such as RGB
color and assume uniform superpixel sizes. Obtaining a dominant label per
superpixel drastically reduces annotators' burden as it requires fewer clicks.
However, it inevitably introduces noisy annotations due to mismatches between
superpixel and ground truth segmentation. To address this issue, we further
devise a sieving mechanism that identifies and excludes potentially noisy
annotations from learning. Our experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of adaptive superpixel and sieving
mechanisms.",None,-1

Bridging the Gap between Model Explanations in Partially Annotated Multi-label Classification,0.451894,"Due to the expensive costs of collecting labels in multi-label classification
datasets, partially annotated multi-label classification has become an emerging
field in computer vision. One baseline approach to this task is to assume
unobserved labels as negative labels, but this assumption induces label noise

negative labels, we study how these labels affect the model's explanation. We
observe that the explanation of two models, trained with full and partial
labels each, highlights similar regions but with different scaling, where the
latter tends to have lower attribution scores. Based on these findings, we
propose to boost the attribution scores of the model trained with partial
labels to make its explanation resemble that of the model trained with full

contrastive learning objective to improve the representation for localization
tasks. Unlike standard MAE, we perform reconstruction in the joint image-text

MAE method, which causes the model to better learn region-level semantics.
Moreover, we introduce Positional Embedding Dropout (PED) to address scale
variation between image-text pretraining and detection finetuning by randomly
dropping out the positional embeddings during pretraining. PED improves
detection performance and enables the use of a frozen ViT backbone as a region
classifier, preventing the forgetting of open-vocabulary knowledge during

Unsupervised Learning for Combinatorial Optimization Needs Meta-Learning,0.764459,"A general framework of unsupervised learning for combinatorial optimization

R2H: Building Multimodal Navigation Helpers that Respond to Help Requests,0.392616,"Intelligent navigation-helper agents are critical as they can navigate users

this work, we first introduce a novel benchmark, Respond to Help Requests

responding to requests for help, utilizing existing dialog-based embodied
datasets. R2H mainly includes two tasks: (1) Respond to Dialog History (RDH),
which assesses the helper agent's ability to generate informative responses
based on a given dialog history, and (2) Respond during Interaction (RdI),
which evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the response during
consistent cooperation with a task performer. Furthermore, we explore two
approaches to construct the navigation-helper agent, including fine-tuning a

Learned Thresholds Token Merging and Pruning for Vision Transformers,0.229751,"Vision transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of
computer vision tasks over the last years. However, their high computational
costs remain a significant barrier to their practical deployment. In
particular, the complexity of transformer models is quadratic with respect to
the number of input tokens. Therefore techniques that reduce the number of
input tokens that need to be processed have been proposed. This paper
introduces Learned Thresholds token Merging and Pruning (LTMP), a novel
approach that leverages the strengths of both token merging and token pruning.
LTMP uses learned threshold masking modules that dynamically determine which
tokens to merge and which to prune. We demonstrate our approach with extensive
experiments on vision transformers on the ImageNet classification task. Our
results demonstrate that LTMP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across
reduction rates while requiring only a single fine-tuning epoch, which is an
order of magnitude faster than previous methods. Code is available at

Randomized Adversarial Style Perturbations for Domain Generalization,0.0796691,"We propose a novel domain generalization technique, referred to as Randomized
Adversarial Style Perturbation (RASP), which is motivated by the observation
that the characteristics of each domain are captured by the feature statistics
corresponding to style. The proposed algorithm perturbs the style of a feature
in an adversarial direction towards a randomly selected class, and makes the
model learn against being misled by the unexpected styles observed in unseen
target domains. While RASP is effective to handle domain shifts, its naive
integration into the training procedure might degrade the capability of
learning knowledge from source domains because it has no restriction on the
perturbations of representations. This challenge is alleviated by Normalized
Feature Mixup (NFM), which facilitates the learning of the original features
while achieving robustness to perturbed representations via their mixup during
training. We evaluate the proposed algorithm via extensive experiments on
various benchmarks and show that our approach improves domain generalization
performance, especially in large-scale benchmarks.",None,-1

the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) is critical for understanding the behavior of

involves approximating the velocity component by employing the derivative of a
stream function. This assumption serves to simplify the system and guarantees
that the velocity adheres to the divergence-free equation. We also developed a
second more flexible model that approximates the solution without any

Moreover, we successfully applied the second model to solve the
three-dimensional NSE. The results show that the models can efficiently and
accurately solve the NSE in three dimensions. These approaches offer several

How To Build Competitive Multi-gender Speech Translation Models For Controlling Speaker Gender Translation,0.225314,"When translating from notional gender languages (e.g., English) into
grammatical gender languages (e.g., Italian), the generated translation
requires explicit gender assignments for various words, including those

speaker's gender, speech translation (ST) models either rely on the
possibly-misleading vocal traits of the speaker or default to the masculine
gender, the most frequent in existing training corpora. To avoid such biased
and not inclusive behaviors, the gender assignment of speaker-related
expressions should be guided by externally-provided metadata about the
speaker's gender. While previous work has shown that the most effective
solution is represented by separate, dedicated gender-specific models, the goal
of this paper is to achieve the same results by integrating the speaker's
gender metadata into a single ""multi-gender"" neural ST model, easier to
maintain. Our experiments demonstrate that a single multi-gender model

Minimum Coverage Sets for Training Robust Ad Hoc Teamwork Agents,0.795438,"Robustly cooperating with unseen agents and human partners presents
significant challenges due to the diverse cooperative conventions these
partners may adopt. Existing Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) methods address this
challenge by training an agent with a population of diverse teammate policies

heuristic-based diversity metrics do not always maximize the agent's robustness

AHT agent's robustness requires it to emulate policies in the minimum coverage
set (MCS), the set of best-response policies to any partner policies in the
environment. We then introduce the L-BRDiv algorithm that generates a set of
teammate policies that, when used for AHT training, encourage agents to emulate
policies from the MCS. L-BRDiv works by solving a constrained optimization
problem to jointly train teammate policies for AHT training and approximating
AHT agent policies that are members of the MCS. We empirically demonstrate that
L-BRDiv produces more robust AHT agents than state-of-the-art methods in a
broader range of two-player cooperative problems without the need for extensive
hyperparameter tuning for its objectives. Our study shows that L-BRDiv

when needed. However, knowing when to request such assistance is critical: too
few requests can lead to the robot making mistakes, but too many requests can
overload the expert. In this paper, we present a Reinforcement Learning based
approach to this problem, where a semi-autonomous agent asks for external
assistance when it has low confidence in the eventual success of the task. The
confidence level is computed by estimating the variance of the return from the
current state. We show that this estimate can be iteratively improved during
training using a Bellman-like recursion. On discrete navigation problems with
both fully- and partially-observable state information, we show that our method
makes effective use of a limited budget of expert calls at run-time, despite
having no access to the expert at training time.",None,-1
GPT4MIA: Utilizing Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) as A Plug-and-Play Transductive Model for Medical Image Analysis,0.0819596,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach (called GPT4MIA) that utilizes
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a plug-and-play transductive
inference tool for medical image analysis (MIA). We provide theoretical
analysis on why a large pre-trained language model such as GPT-3 can be used as
a plug-and-play transductive inference model for MIA. At the methodological
level, we develop several technical treatments to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of GPT4MIA, including better prompt structure design, sample
selection, and prompt ordering of representative samples/features. We present
two concrete use cases (with workflow) of GPT4MIA: (1) detecting prediction
errors and (2) improving prediction accuracy, working in conjecture with
well-established vision-based models for image classification (e.g., ResNet).
Experiments validate that our proposed method is effective for these two tasks.
We further discuss the opportunities and challenges in utilizing
Transformer-based large language models for broader MIA applications.",None,-1
SemHint-MD: Learning from Noisy Semantic Labels for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation,0.186522,"Without ground truth supervision, self-supervised depth estimation can be
trapped in a local minimum due to the gradient-locality issue of the
photometric loss. In this paper, we present a framework to enhance depth by
leveraging semantic segmentation to guide the network to jump out of the local
minimum. Prior works have proposed to share encoders between these two tasks or
explicitly align them based on priors like the consistency between edges in the
depth and segmentation maps. Yet, these methods usually require ground truth or
high-quality pseudo labels, which may not be easily accessible in real-world
applications. In contrast, we investigate self-supervised depth estimation
along with a segmentation branch that is supervised with noisy labels provided
by models pre-trained with limited data. We extend parameter sharing from the
encoder to the decoder and study the influence of different numbers of shared
decoder parameters on model performance. Also, we propose to use cross-task
information to refine current depth and segmentation predictions to generate
pseudo-depth and semantic labels for training. The advantages of the proposed
method are demonstrated through extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark

Aligning Bag of Regions for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,0.856991,"Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) learn to align vision and language
representations on large-scale datasets, where each image-text pair usually
contains a bag of semantic concepts. However, existing open-vocabulary object
detectors only align region embeddings individually with the corresponding
features extracted from the VLMs. Such a design leaves the compositional
structure of semantic concepts in a scene under-exploited, although the
structure may be implicitly learned by the VLMs. In this work, we propose to
align the embedding of bag of regions beyond individual regions. The proposed
method groups contextually interrelated regions as a bag. The embeddings of
regions in a bag are treated as embeddings of words in a sentence, and they are
sent to the text encoder of a VLM to obtain the bag-of-regions embedding, which
is learned to be aligned to the corresponding features extracted by a frozen
VLM. Applied to the commonly used Faster R-CNN, our approach surpasses the

EndoSurf: Neural Surface Reconstruction of Deformable Tissues with Stereo Endoscope Videos,0.914755,"Reconstructing soft tissues from stereo endoscope videos is an essential
prerequisite for many medical applications. Previous methods struggle to
produce high-quality geometry and appearance due to their inadequate
representations of 3D scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel
neural-field-based method, called EndoSurf, which effectively learns to
represent a deforming surface from an RGBD sequence. In EndoSurf, we model
surface dynamics, shape, and texture with three neural fields. First, 3D points
are transformed from the observed space to the canonical space using the
deformation field. The signed distance function (SDF) field and radiance field
then predict their SDFs and colors, respectively, with which RGBD images can be
synthesized via differentiable volume rendering. We constrain the learned shape
by tailoring multiple regularization strategies and disentangling geometry and
appearance. Experiments on public endoscope datasets demonstrate that EndoSurf
significantly outperforms existing solutions, particularly in reconstructing

SensePOLAR: Word sense aware interpretability for pre-trained contextual word embeddings,0.221102,"Adding interpretability to word embeddings represents an area of active

words, they have not been designed to deal with polysemy, i.e. they can not
easily distinguish between different senses of words. To address this
limitation, we present SensePOLAR, an extension of the original POLAR framework
that enables word-sense aware interpretability for pre-trained contextual word
embeddings. The resulting interpretable word embeddings achieve a level of
performance that is comparable to original contextual word embeddings across a

Enhancing Large Language Model with Self-Controlled Memory Framework,0.0772392,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by their inability to process
lengthy inputs, resulting in the loss of critical historical information. To
address this limitation, in this paper, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory
(SCM) framework to enhance the ability of LLMs to maintain long-term memory and
recall relevant information. Our SCM framework comprises three key components:
an LLM-based agent serving as the backbone of the framework, a memory stream
storing agent memories, and a memory controller updating memories and
determining when and how to utilize memories from memory stream. Additionally,
the proposed SCM is able to process ultra-long texts without any modification
or fine-tuning, which can integrate with any instruction following LLMs in a
plug-and-play paradigm. Furthermore, we annotate a dataset to evaluate the
effectiveness of SCM for handling lengthy inputs. The annotated dataset covers
three tasks: long-term dialogues, book summarization, and meeting

Generative Knowledge Selection for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogues,0.679619,"Knowledge selection is the key in knowledge-grounded dialogues (KGD), which

The Importance of Time in Causal Algorithmic Recourse,0.332348,"The application of Algorithmic Recourse in decision-making is a promising
field that offers practical solutions to reverse unfavorable decisions.
However, the inability of these methods to consider potential dependencies
among variables poses a significant challenge due to the assumption of feature
independence. Recent advancements have incorporated knowledge of causal
dependencies, thereby enhancing the quality of the recommended recourse
actions. Despite these improvements, the inability to incorporate the temporal
dimension remains a significant limitation of these approaches. This is
particularly problematic as identifying and addressing the root causes of
undesired outcomes requires understanding time-dependent relationships between
variables. In this work, we motivate the need to integrate the temporal
dimension into causal algorithmic recourse methods to enhance recommendations'
plausibility and reliability. The experimental evaluation highlights the
significance of the role of time in this field.",None,-1
Goals are Enough: Inducing AdHoc cooperation among unseen Multi-Agent systems in IMFs,0.464739,"Intent-based management will play a critical role in achieving customers'
expectations in the next-generation mobile networks. Traditional methods cannot
perform efficient resource management since they tend to handle each
expectation independently. Existing approaches, e.g., based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) allocate resources in an efficient fashion when
there are conflicting expectations on the network slice. However, in reality,
systems are often far more complex to be addressed by a standalone MARL
formulation. Often there exists a hierarchical structure of intent fulfilment
where multiple pre-trained, self-interested agents may need to be further
orchestrated by a supervisor or controller agent. Such agents may arrive in the
system adhoc, which then needs to be orchestrated along with other available
agents. Retraining the whole system every time is often infeasible given the
associated time and cost. Given the challenges, such adhoc coordination of
pre-trained systems could be achieved through an intelligent supervisor agent
which incentivizes pre-trained RL/MARL agents through sets of dynamic contracts
(goals or bonuses) and encourages them to act as a cohesive unit towards
fulfilling a global expectation. Some approaches use a rule-based supervisor
agent and deploy the hierarchical constituent agents sequentially, based on
human-coded rules.
  In the current work, we propose a framework whereby pre-trained agents can be
orchestrated in parallel leveraging an AI-based supervisor agent. For this, we
propose to use Adhoc-Teaming approaches which assign optimal goals to the MARL
agents and incentivize them to exhibit certain desired behaviours. Results on
the network emulator show that the proposed approach results in faster and
improved fulfilment of expectations when compared to rule-based approaches and
even generalizes to changes in environments.",None,-1
Prototype Knowledge Distillation for Medical Segmentation with Missing Modality,0.646528,"Multi-modality medical imaging is crucial in clinical treatment as it can
provide complementary information for medical image segmentation. However,
collecting multi-modal data in clinical is difficult due to the limitation of
the scan time and other clinical situations. As such, it is clinically
meaningful to develop an image segmentation paradigm to handle this missing
modality problem. In this paper, we propose a prototype knowledge distillation
(ProtoKD) method to tackle the challenging problem, especially for the toughest
scenario when only single modal data can be accessed. Specifically, our ProtoKD
can not only distillate the pixel-wise knowledge of multi-modality data to
single-modality data but also transfer intra-class and inter-class feature
variations, such that the student model could learn more robust feature
representation from the teacher model and inference with only one single
modality data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on BraTS

Learning Sparse and Low-Rank Priors for Image Recovery via Iterative Reweighted Least Squares Minimization,0.327946,"We introduce a novel optimization algorithm for image recovery under learned

minimization approach as a recurrent network that we then employ to deal with
inverse low-level computer vision problems. Thanks to the convergence
guarantees that our IRLS strategy offers, we are able to train the derived
reconstruction networks using a memory-efficient implicit back-propagation
scheme, which does not pose any restrictions on their effective depth. To
assess our networks' performance, we compare them against other existing
reconstruction methods on several inverse problems, namely image deblurring,

The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Human and Machine Translations for Multilingual Semantic Parsing with Active Learning,0.4696,"Multilingual semantic parsing aims to leverage the knowledge from the

iteratively adding small batches of human translations into the
machine-translated training set. Besides, we propose novel aggregated

Transfer Learning and Class Decomposition for Detecting the Cognitive Decline of Alzheimer Disease,0.127708,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential in preventing the
disease's progression. Therefore, detecting AD from neuroimaging data such as
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been a topic of intense
investigation in recent years. Deep learning has gained considerable attention
in Alzheimer's detection. However, training a convolutional neural network from

significant amount of annotated data. By transferring knowledge learned from
other image recognition tasks to medical image classification, transfer
learning can provide a promising and effective solution. Irregularities in the
dataset distribution present another difficulty. Class decomposition can tackle
this issue by simplifying learning a dataset's class boundaries. Motivated by
these approaches, this paper proposes a transfer learning method using class
decomposition to detect Alzheimer's disease from sMRI images. We use two

Federated Neural Radiance Fields,0.2223,"The ability of neural radiance fields or NeRFs to conduct accurate 3D

whereby multiple compute nodes, each having acquired a distinct set of
observations of the overall scene, learn a common NeRF in parallel. This
supports the scenario of cooperatively modelling a scene using multiple agents.
Our contribution is the first federated learning algorithm for NeRF, which
splits the training effort across multiple compute nodes and obviates the need
to pool the images at a central node. A technique based on low-rank
decomposition of NeRF layers is introduced to reduce bandwidth consumption to
transmit the model parameters for aggregation. Transferring compressed models

Probing neural representations of scene perception in a hippocampally dependent task using artificial neural networks,0.220326,"Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) trained through backpropagation
provide effective models of the mammalian visual system, accurately capturing
the hierarchy of neural responses through primary visual cortex to inferior

less well researched. For example, DNNs have been less successful as a model of
the egocentric to allocentric transformation embodied by circuits in
retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex. We describe a novel scene
perception benchmark inspired by a hippocampal dependent task, designed to
probe the ability of DNNs to transform scenes viewed from different egocentric

Is forgetting less a good inductive bias for forward transfer?,0.491911,"One of the main motivations of studying continual learning is that the
problem setting allows a model to accrue knowledge from past tasks to learn new
tasks more efficiently. However, recent studies suggest that the key metric
that continual learning algorithms optimize, reduction in catastrophic
forgetting, does not correlate well with the forward transfer of knowledge. We
believe that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they
measure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a
task should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner
in order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer
should be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of
representations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this
notion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms
on a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less
forgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong
correlation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new
tasks. Further, we found less forgetful representations to be more diverse and

StyLess: Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Examples,0.448485,"Adversarial attacks can mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) by adding

a vanilla network as the surrogate model, we advocate using stylized networks,
which encode different style features by perturbing an adaptive instance
normalization. Our method can prevent adversarial examples from using
non-robust style features and help generate transferable perturbations.
Comprehensive experiments show that our method can significantly improve the

SpinDOE: A ball spin estimation method for table tennis robot,0.701458,"Spin plays a considerable role in table tennis, making a shot's trajectory
harder to read and predict. However, the spin is challenging to measure because
of the ball's high velocity and the magnitude of the spin values. Existing

because they use the ball's logo, which may not always be visible. Because of
this, many table tennis-playing robots ignore the spin, which severely limits
their capabilities. This paper proposes an easily implementable and reliable
spin estimation method. We developed a dotted-ball orientation estimation (DOE)

localized on the image using a CNN and then identified using geometric hashing.
The spin is finally regressed from the estimated orientations. Using our

Knowledge Graph-Augmented Language Models for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation,0.857866,"Language models have achieved impressive performances on dialogue generation

Skip-Attention: Improving Vision Transformers by Paying Less Attention,0.21812,"This work aims to improve the efficiency of vision transformers (ViT). While
ViTs use computationally expensive self-attention operations in every layer, we
identify that these operations are highly correlated across layers -- a key
redundancy that causes unnecessary computations. Based on this observation, we
propose SkipAt, a method to reuse self-attention computation from preceding
layers to approximate attention at one or more subsequent layers. To ensure
that reusing self-attention blocks across layers does not degrade the
performance, we introduce a simple parametric function, which outperforms the
baseline transformer's performance while running computationally faster. We
show the effectiveness of our method in image classification and
self-supervised learning on ImageNet-1K, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, image
denoising on SIDD, and video denoising on DAVIS. We achieve improved throughput

AI Art Curation: Re-imagining the city of Helsinki in occasion of its Biennial,0.0966447,"Art curatorial practice is characterized by the presentation of an art
collection in a knowledgeable way. Machine processes are characterized by their
capacity to manage and analyze large amounts of data. This paper envisages AI
curation and audience interaction to explore the implications of contemporary
machine learning models for the curatorial world. This project was developed
for the occasion of the 2023 Helsinki Art Biennial, entitled New Directions May
Emerge. We use the Helsinki Art Museum (HAM) collection to re-imagine the city
of Helsinki through the lens of machine perception. We use visual-textual
models to place indoor artworks in public spaces, assigning fictional

artwork inhabits in the city by generating synthetic 360 art panoramas. We
guide the generation estimating depth values from 360 panoramas at each artwork
location, and machine-generated prompts of the artworks. The result of this

Enhancing Breast Cancer Risk Prediction by Incorporating Prior Images,0.768886,"Recently, deep learning models have shown the potential to predict breast
cancer risk and enable targeted screening strategies, but current models do not

Evaluation of Induced Expert Knowledge in Causal Structure Learning by NOTEARS,0.438177,"Causal modeling provides us with powerful counterfactual reasoning and
interventional mechanism to generate predictions and reason under various
what-if scenarios. However, causal discovery using observation data remains a
nontrivial task due to unobserved confounding factors, finite sampling, and
changes in the data distribution. These can lead to spurious cause-effect
relationships. To mitigate these challenges in practice, researchers augment
causal learning with known causal relations. The goal of the paper is to study
the impact of expert knowledge on causal relations in the form of additional
constraints used in the formulation of the nonparametric NOTEARS. We provide a
comprehensive set of comparative analyses of biasing the model using different
types of knowledge. We found that (i) knowledge that corrects the mistakes of
the NOTEARS model can lead to statistically significant improvements, (ii)
constraints on active edges have a larger positive impact on causal discovery

Mind the Gap! Bridging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Human Understanding with Luhmann's Functional Theory of Communication,0.311715,"Over the past decade explainable artificial intelligence has evolved from a
predominantly technical discipline into a field that is deeply intertwined with
social sciences. Insights such as human preference for contrastive -- more
precisely, counterfactual -- explanations have played a major role in this
transition, inspiring and guiding the research in computer science. Other
observations, while equally important, have received much less attention. The
desire of human explainees to communicate with artificial intelligence
explainers through a dialogue-like interaction has been mostly neglected by the
community. This poses many challenges for the effectiveness and widespread
adoption of such technologies as delivering a single explanation optimised
according to some predefined objectives may fail to engender understanding in
its recipients and satisfy their unique needs given the diversity of human

Med-EASi: Finely Annotated Dataset and Models for Controllable Simplification of Medical Texts,0.617886,"Automatic medical text simplification can assist providers with

Object Preserving Siamese Network for Single Object Tracking on Point Clouds,0.0946944,"Obviously, the object is the key factor of the 3D single object tracking

tracking performance. Firstly, the object highlighting module enhances the
object-aware features and extracts discriminative features from template and
search area. Then, the object-preserved sampling selects object candidates to
obtain object-preserved search area seeds and drop the background points that
contribute less to tracking. Finally, the object localization network precisely

Exploring Paracrawl for Document-level Neural Machine Translation,0.349132,"Document-level neural machine translation (NMT) has outperformed
sentence-level NMT on a number of datasets. However, document-level NMT is

Trust Region-Based Safe Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Constraints,0.522158,"In safety-critical robotic tasks, potential failures must be reduced, and

metaphor can be one of the reasons for metaphors' superiority in emotion
expression. When we compare metaphors with literal expressions with the same
specificity level, the gap of emotion expressing ability between both reduces
significantly. In addition, we observe specificity is crucial in literal

Fine-grained Emotional Control of Text-To-Speech: Learning To Rank Inter- And Intra-Class Emotion Intensities,0.427374,"State-of-the-art Text-To-Speech (TTS) models are capable of producing

TransFace: Calibrating Transformer Training for Face Recognition from a Data-Centric Perspective,0.649053,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated powerful representation ability
in various visual tasks thanks to their intrinsic data-hungry nature. However,
we unexpectedly find that ViTs perform vulnerably when applied to face

reasons for this phenomenon and discover that the existing data augmentation
approach and hard sample mining strategy are incompatible with ViTs-based FR
backbone due to the lack of tailored consideration on preserving face
structural information and leveraging each local token information. To remedy
these problems, this paper proposes a superior FR model called TransFace, which
employs a patch-level data augmentation strategy named DPAP and a hard sample
mining strategy named EHSM. Specially, DPAP randomly perturbs the amplitude
information of dominant patches to expand sample diversity, which effectively
alleviates the overfitting problem in ViTs. EHSM utilizes the information
entropy in the local tokens to dynamically adjust the importance weight of easy

Modality Plug-and-Play: Elastic Modality Adaptation in Multimodal LLMs for Embodied AI,0.121113,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reasoning over diverse input data

The Treasure Beneath Multiple Annotations: An Uncertainty-aware Edge Detector,0.811518,"Deep learning-based edge detectors heavily rely on pixel-wise labels which
are often provided by multiple annotators. Existing methods fuse multiple
annotations using a simple voting process, ignoring the inherent ambiguity of
edges and labeling bias of annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel
uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED), which employs uncertainty to
investigate the subjectivity and ambiguity of diverse annotations.
Specifically, we first convert the deterministic label space into a learnable
Gaussian distribution, whose variance measures the degree of ambiguity among
different annotations. Then we regard the learned variance as the estimated
uncertainty of the predicted edge maps, and pixels with higher uncertainty are
likely to be hard samples for edge detection. Therefore we design an adaptive
weighting loss to emphasize the learning from those pixels with high
uncertainty, which helps the network to gradually concentrate on the important
pixels. UAED can be combined with various encoder-decoder backbones, and the
extensive experiments demonstrate that UAED achieves superior performance
consistently across multiple edge detection benchmarks. The source code is

DyLiN: Making Light Field Networks Dynamic,0.924527,"Light Field Networks, the re-formulations of radiance fields to oriented

static scenes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Light Field Network
(DyLiN) method that can handle non-rigid deformations, including topological
changes. We learn a deformation field from input rays to canonical rays, and
lift them into a higher dimensional space to handle discontinuities. We further
introduce CoDyLiN, which augments DyLiN with controllable attribute inputs. We
train both models via knowledge distillation from pretrained dynamic radiance
fields. We evaluated DyLiN using both synthetic and real world datasets that

ChiroDiff: Modelling chirographic data with Diffusion Models,0.343674,"Generative modelling over continuous-time geometric constructs, a.k.a such as
handwriting, sketches, drawings etc., have been accomplished through
autoregressive distributions. Such strictly-ordered discrete factorization

visibility (causality). Consequently, temporal data has been modelled as
discrete token sequences of fixed sampling rate instead of capturing the true
underlying concept. In this paper, we introduce a powerful model-class namely
""Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models"" or DDPMs for chirographic data that
specifically addresses these flaws. Our model named ""ChiroDiff"", being
non-autoregressive, learns to capture holistic concepts and therefore remains
resilient to higher temporal sampling rate up to a good extent. Moreover, we

creative mixing) can be flexibly implemented using ChiroDiff. We further show

Modeling Continuous Motion for 3D Point Cloud Object Tracking,0.243768,"The task of 3D single object tracking (SOT) with LiDAR point clouds is

continuous stream: at each timestamp, only the current frame is fed into the
network to interact with multi-frame historical features stored in a memory
bank, enabling efficient exploitation of sequential information. To achieve
effective cross-frame message passing, a hybrid attention mechanism is designed
to account for both long-range relation modeling and local geometric feature

Synthetic Prompting: Generating Chain-of-Thought Demonstrations for Large Language Models,0.273212,"Large language models can perform various reasoning tasks by using
chain-of-thought prompting, which guides them to find answers through
step-by-step demonstrations. However, the quality of the prompts depends on the
demonstrations given to the models, and creating many of them by hand is
costly. We introduce Synthetic prompting, a method that leverages a few
handcrafted examples to prompt the model to generate more examples by itself,
and selects effective demonstrations to elicit better reasoning. Our method
alternates between a backward and forward process to generate new examples. The
backward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so
that the question is solvable and clear. The forward process produces a more
detailed reasoning chain for the question, improving the quality of the
example. We evaluate our method on numerical, symbolic, and algorithmic
reasoning tasks, and show that it outperforms existing prompting techniques.",None,-1
Literal-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding for Welding Quality Monitoring: A Bosch Case,0.317137,"Recently there has been a series of studies in knowledge graph embedding
(KGE), which attempts to learn the embeddings of the entities and relations as
numerical vectors and mathematical mappings via machine learning (ML). However,
there has been limited research that applies KGE for industrial problems in
manufacturing. This paper investigates whether and to what extent KGE can be
used for an important problem: quality monitoring for welding in manufacturing
industry, which is an impactful process accounting for production of millions
of cars annually. The work is in line with Bosch research of data-driven
solutions that intends to replace the traditional way of destroying cars, which
is extremely costly and produces waste. The paper tackles two very challenging
questions simultaneously: how large the welding spot diameter is; and to which
car body the welded spot belongs to. The problem setting is difficult for
traditional ML because there exist a high number of car bodies that should be
assigned as class labels. We formulate the problem as link prediction, and
experimented popular KGE methods on real industry data, with consideration of

KGE methods.",None,-1
Behavioral Analysis of Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents,0.471945,"To be successful, Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents must be able to
ground instructions to actions based on their surroundings. In this work, we

and moving towards specified objects or rooms. Our approach is based on
generating skill-specific interventions and measuring changes in agent
predictions. We present a detailed case study analyzing the behavior of a
recent agent and then compare multiple agents in terms of skill-specific

Improving Zero-Shot Action Recognition using Human Instruction with Text Description,0.110111,"Zero-shot action recognition, which recognizes actions in videos without
having received any training examples, is gaining wide attention considering it

zero-shot action recognition using human instructions with text descriptions.
The proposed framework manually describes video contents, which incurs some
labor costs; in many situations, the labor costs are worth it. We manually
annotate text features for each action, which can be a word, phrase, or
sentence. Then by computing the matching degrees between the video and all text

Continual Learning with Dirichlet Generative-based Rehearsal,0.502339,"Recent advancements in data-driven task-oriented dialogue systems (ToDs)

language understanding and reasoning inspires us to rethink the problem from a
model-centric perspective, where task preparation, comprehension, and execution
are handled by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce AutoDroid,
a mobile task automation system capable of handling arbitrary tasks on any

Certified Robust Neural Networks: Generalization and Corruption Resistance,0.345281,"Recent work have demonstrated that robustness (to ""corruption"") can be at
odds with generalization. Adversarial training, for instance, aims to reduce
the problematic susceptibility of modern neural networks to small data

empirically the loss to enjoy a certified level of robustness against two
common types of corruption--data evasion and poisoning attacks--while ensuring
guaranteed generalization. We show through careful numerical experiments that
our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance.

extract semantic features of the image, which are then partitioned into patches
that serve as nodes in the graph. Then, we use a masked graph convolutional

structural information. Finally, we incorporate multiple losses to explore the

STNet: Spatial and Temporal feature fusion network for change detection in remote sensing images,0.360282,"As an important task in remote sensing image analysis, remote sensing change

Calib-Anything: Zero-training LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration Method Using Segment Anything,0.907193,"The research on extrinsic calibration between Light Detection and

approximation. Our main results provide finite-sample guarantees up to a
localization error and a function approximation error. Specifically, we achieve

Rolling Horizon based Temporal Decomposition for the Offline Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows,0.236943,"The offline pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) is a
classical combinatorial optimization problem in the transportation community,
which has proven to be very challenging computationally. Due to the complexity
of the problem, practical problem instances can be solved only via heuristics,
which trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the
various heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the
reduction of a large-scale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems,
with spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While
spatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective
temporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching
together the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this

Anthropomorphization of AI: Opportunities and Risks,0.899339,"Anthropomorphization is the tendency to attribute human-like traits to

PASS: Peer-Agreement based Sample Selection for training with Noisy Labels,0.146227,"The prevalence of noisy-label samples poses a significant challenge in deep

strategies to each group of samples. Current methodologies often rely on the
small-loss hypothesis or feature-based selection to separate noisy- and

Universal Morphology Control via Contextual Modulation,0.181193,"Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can

parameter sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate
morphology-dependent control parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention

Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents,0.182522,"Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents

agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent
operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by
norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we
propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where
values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals
intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level
by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue
that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an
understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in
autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to
align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values
instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with
agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms
that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the

Conversation Style Transfer using Few-Shot Learning,0.379243,"Conventional text style transfer approaches focus on sentence-level style

Emotion Recognition based on Psychological Components in Guided Narratives for Emotion Regulation,0.684019,"Emotion regulation is a crucial element in dealing with emotional events and
has positive effects on mental health. This paper aims to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of emotional events by introducing a new French
corpus of emotional narratives collected using a questionnaire for emotion
regulation. We follow the theoretical framework of the Component Process Model
which considers emotions as dynamic processes composed of four interrelated
components (behavior, feeling, thinking and territory). Each narrative is
related to a discrete emotion and is structured based on all emotion components
by the writers. We study the interaction of components and their impact on
emotion classification with machine learning methods and pre-trained language
models. Our results show that each component improves prediction performance,
and that the best results are achieved by jointly considering all components.
Our results also show the effectiveness of pre-trained language models in

SpeechPrompt v2: Prompt Tuning for Speech Classification Tasks,0.989537,"Prompt tuning is a technology that tunes a small set of parameters to steer a
pre-trained language model (LM) to directly generate the output for downstream

approach to serving pre-trained LM for multiple tasks in a unified manner. For
speech processing, SpeechPrompt shows its high parameter efficiency and
competitive performance on a few speech classification tasks. However, whether
SpeechPrompt is capable of serving a large number of tasks is unanswered. In

Model-Generated Pretraining Signals Improves Zero-Shot Generalization of Text-to-Text Transformers,0.0817354,"This paper explores the effectiveness of model-generated signals in improving
zero-shot generalization of text-to-text Transformers such as T5. We study
various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more
challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under
study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the
masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METRO-T0,
which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies

Exploring Linguistic Similarity and Zero-Shot Learning for Multilingual Translation of Dravidian Languages,0.0243025,"Current research in zero-shot translation is plagued by several issues such
as high compute requirements, increased training time and off target
translations. Proposed remedies often come at the cost of additional data or

We build a single encoder-decoder neural machine translation system for
Dravidian-Dravidian multilingual translation and perform zero-shot translation.
We compare the data vs zero-shot accuracy tradeoff and evaluate the performance
of our vanilla method against the current state of the art pivot based method.
We also test the theory that morphologically rich languages require large

language modalities, VLMs may generate incorrect perception information when
doing downstream applications, for example, captioning a non-existent entity.
To address the hallucination phenomenon, on the one hand, we introduce a
Contrastive Instruction Evaluation Method (CIEM), which is an automatic
pipeline that leverages an annotated image-text dataset coupled with an LLM to
generate factual/contrastive question-answer pairs for the evaluation of the

new instruction tuning method called CIT (the abbreviation of Contrastive
Instruction Tuning) to alleviate the hallucination of VLMs by automatically
producing high-quality factual/contrastive question-answer pairs and
corresponding justifications for model tuning. Through extensive experiments on
CIEM and CIT, we pinpoint the hallucination issues commonly present in existing

An End-to-End Framework For Universal Lesion Detection With Missing Annotations,0.299054,"Fully annotated large-scale medical image datasets are highly valuable.
However, because labeling medical images is tedious and requires specialized
knowledge, the large-scale datasets available often have missing annotation
issues. For instance, DeepLesion, a large-scale CT image dataset with labels
for various kinds of lesions, is reported to have a missing annotation rate of
50\%. Directly training a lesion detector on it would suffer from false
negative supervision caused by unannotated lesions. To address this issue,
previous works have used sophisticated multi-stage strategies to switch between
lesion mining and detector training. In this work, we present a novel
end-to-end framework for mining unlabeled lesions while simultaneously training
the detector. Our framework follows the teacher-student paradigm. In each
iteration, the teacher model infers the input data and creates a set of
predictions. High-confidence predictions are combined with partially-labeled
ground truth for training the student model. On the DeepLesion dataset, using

Toward Open-ended Embodied Tasks Solving,0.640492,"Empowering embodied agents, such as robots, with Artificial Intelligence (AI)

HoloDiffusion: Training a 3D Diffusion Model using 2D Images,0.821449,"Diffusion models have emerged as the best approach for generative modeling of
2D images. Part of their success is due to the possibility of training them on
millions if not billions of images with a stable learning objective. However,
extending these models to 3D remains difficult for two reasons. First, finding
a large quantity of 3D training data is much more complex than for 2D images.
Second, while it is conceptually trivial to extend the models to operate on 3D
rather than 2D grids, the associated cubic growth in memory and compute
complexity makes this infeasible. We address the first challenge by introducing
a new diffusion setup that can be trained, end-to-end, with only posed 2D
images for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing an image
formation model that decouples model memory from spatial memory. We evaluate
our method on real-world data, using the CO3D dataset which has not been used

The Limits of ChatGPT in Extracting Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment Quadruples: A Comparative Analysis,0.289069,"Recently, ChatGPT has attracted great attention from both industry and
academia due to its surprising abilities in natural language understanding and
generation. We are particularly curious about whether it can achieve promising
performance on one of the most complex tasks in aspect-based sentiment
analysis, i.e., extracting aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples from
texts. To this end, in this paper we develop a specialized prompt template that
enables ChatGPT to effectively tackle this complex quadruple extraction task.
Further, we propose a selection method on few-shot examples to fully exploit
the in-context learning ability of ChatGPT and uplift its effectiveness on this
complex task. Finally, we provide a comparative evaluation on ChatGPT against
existing state-of-the-art quadruple extraction models based on four public

"Explaining Groups of Instances Counterfactually for XAI: A Use Case, Algorithm and User Study for Group-Counterfactuals",0.428229,"Counterfactual explanations are an increasingly popular form of post hoc
explanation due to their (i) applicability across problem domains, (ii)
proposed legal compliance (e.g., with GDPR), and (iii) reliance on the
contrastive nature of human explanation. Although counterfactual explanations
are normally used to explain individual predictive-instances, we explore a
novel use case in which groups of similar instances are explained in a
collective fashion using ``group counterfactuals'' (e.g., to highlight a
repeating pattern of illness in a group of patients). These group
counterfactuals meet a human preference for coherent, broad explanations
covering multiple events/instances. A novel, group-counterfactual algorithm is
proposed to generate high-coverage explanations that are faithful to the
to-be-explained model. This explanation strategy is also evaluated in a large,
controlled user study (N=207), using objective (i.e., accuracy) and subjective
(i.e., confidence, explanation satisfaction, and trust) psychological measures.
The results show that group counterfactuals elicit modest but definite
improvements in people's understanding of an AI system. The implications of
these findings for counterfactual methods and for XAI are discussed.",None,-1
A Method for Studying Semantic Construal in Grammatical Constructions with Interpretable Contextual Embedding Spaces,0.170465,"We study semantic construal in grammatical constructions using large language
models. First, we project contextual word embeddings into three interpretable
semantic spaces, each defined by a different set of psycholinguistic feature
norms. We validate these interpretable spaces and then use them to
automatically derive semantic characterizations of lexical items in two
grammatical constructions: nouns in subject or object position within the same
sentence, and the AANN construction (e.g., `a beautiful three days'). We show
that a word in subject position is interpreted as more agentive than the very
same word in object position, and that the nouns in the AANN construction are
interpreted as more measurement-like than when in the canonical alternation.
Our method can probe the distributional meaning of syntactic constructions at a
templatic level, abstracted away from specific lexemes.",None,-1
Knowledge Graph Embedding: An Overview,0.272004,"Many mathematical models have been leveraged to design embeddings for

through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a
comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In
particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1)
distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the
connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend
that might help researchers invent novel and more effective models. Next, we
delve into CompoundE and CompoundE3D, which draw inspiration from 2D and 3D

Prompting Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation in Speech Recognition,0.896655,"The integration of Language Models (LMs) has proven to be an effective way to
address domain shifts in speech recognition. However, these approaches usually

LLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter large language model (LLM). LLM is used in two
ways: 1) second-pass rescoring: reranking N-best hypotheses of a given ASR
system with LLaMA; 2) deep LLM-fusion: incorporating LLM into the decoder of an
encoder-decoder based ASR system. Experiments show that, with only one domain

Salient Span Masking for Temporal Understanding,0.589817,"Salient Span Masking (SSM) has shown itself to be an effective strategy to
improve closed-book question answering performance. SSM extends general masked
language model pretraining by creating additional unsupervised training
sentences that mask a single entity or date span, thus oversampling factual
information. Despite the success of this paradigm, the span types and sampling
strategies are relatively arbitrary and not widely studied for other tasks.
Thus, we investigate SSM from the perspective of temporal tasks, where learning
a good representation of various temporal expressions is important. To that
end, we introduce Temporal Span Masking (TSM) intermediate training. First, we
find that SSM alone improves the downstream performance on three temporal tasks
by an avg. +5.8 points. Further, we are able to achieve additional improvements
(avg. +0.29 points) by adding the TSM task. These comprise the new best
reported results on the targeted tasks. Our analysis suggests that the
effectiveness of SSM stems from the sentences chosen in the training data
rather than the mask choice: sentences with entities frequently also contain
temporal expressions. Nonetheless, the additional targeted spans of TSM can
still improve performance, especially in a zero-shot context.",None,-1
Real-Time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with LiDAR intensity,0.582636,"We propose a novel real-time LiDAR intensity image-based simultaneous
localization and mapping method , which addresses the geometry degeneracy
problem in unstructured environments. Traditional LiDAR-based front-end
odometry mostly relies on geometric features such as points, lines and planes.
A lack of these features in the environment can lead to the failure of the
entire odometry system. To avoid this problem, we extract feature points from
the LiDAR-generated point cloud that match features identified in LiDAR
intensity images. We then use the extracted feature points to perform scan
registration and estimate the robot ego-movement. For the back-end, we jointly
optimize the distance between the corresponding feature points, and the point
to plane distance for planes identified in the map. In addition, we use the
features extracted from intensity images to detect loop closure candidates from
previous scans and perform pose graph optimization. Our experiments show that

Super-Resolution Neural Operator,0.921305,"We propose Super-resolution Neural Operator (SRNO), a deep operator learning
framework that can resolve high-resolution (HR) images at arbitrary scales from
the low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Treating the LR-HR image pairs as
continuous functions approximated with different grid sizes, SRNO learns the
mapping between the corresponding function spaces. From the perspective of
approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional
latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and
then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel
integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to
generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key
characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the
kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type
attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and
therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention
architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for
SR problems to ""hallucinate"" high-frequency information from the LR image.
Experiments show that SRNO outperforms existing continuous SR methods in terms
of both accuracy and running time. Our code is at

Sound Localization from Motion: Jointly Learning Sound Direction and Camera Rotation,0.333623,"The images and sounds that we perceive undergo subtle but geometrically

these tasks solely through self-supervision. A visual model predicts camera
rotation from a pair of images, while an audio model predicts the direction of
sound sources from binaural sounds. We train these models to generate
predictions that agree with one another. At test time, the models can be
deployed independently. To obtain a feature representation that is well-suited
to solving this challenging problem, we also propose a method for learning an

Efficient Computation of Counterfactual Bounds,0.27069,"We assume to be given structural equations over discrete variables inducing a

start by giving a map from structural casual models to credal networks. This
allows us to compute exact counterfactual bounds via algorithms for credal nets
on a subclass of structural causal models. Exact computation is going to be
inefficient in general given that, as we show, causal inference is NP-hard even
on polytrees. We target then approximate bounds via a causal EM scheme. We
evaluate their accuracy by providing credible intervals on the quality of the
approximation; we show through a synthetic benchmark that the EM scheme
delivers accurate results in a fair number of runs. In the course of the
discussion, we also point out what seems to be a neglected limitation to the
trending idea that counterfactual bounds can be computed without knowledge of
the structural equations. We also present a real case study on palliative care

end-to-end architectures, and argue that, despite the increasing popularity of
end-to-end approaches, modular architectures remain preferable when developing
conversational robots designed to execute complex tasks in collaboration with
human users. We also show that most practical HRI architectures tend to be
either robot-centric or dialogue-centric, depending on where developers wish to
place the ``command center'' of their system. While those design choices may be
justified in some application domains, they also limit the robot's ability to
flexibly interleave physical movements and conversational behaviours. We
contend that architectures placing ``action managers'' and ``interaction
managers'' on an equal footing may provide the best path forward for future
human-robot interaction systems.",None,-1
Learning to Localize in Unseen Scenes with Relative Pose Regressors,0.116586,"Relative pose regressors (RPRs) localize a camera by estimating its relative
translation and rotation to a pose-labelled reference. Unlike scene coordinate
regression and absolute pose regression methods, which learn absolute scene
parameters, RPRs can (theoretically) localize in unseen environments, since
they only learn the residual pose between camera pairs. In practice, however,
the performance of RPRs is significantly degraded in unseen scenes. In this
work, we propose to aggregate paired feature maps into latent codes, instead of
operating on global image descriptors, in order to improve the generalization
of RPRs. We implement aggregation with concatenation, projection, and attention
operations (Transformer Encoders) and learn to regress the relative pose
parameters from the resulting latent codes. We further make use of a recently
proposed continuous representation of rotation matrices, which alleviates the
limitations of the commonly used quaternions. Compared to state-of-the-art
RPRs, our model is shown to localize significantly better in unseen
environments, across both indoor and outdoor benchmarks, while maintaining
competitive performance in seen scenes. We validate our findings and
architecture design through multiple ablations. Our code and pretrained models

Why Can Large Language Models Generate Correct Chain-of-Thoughts?,0.381856,"This paper delves into the capabilities of large language models (LLMs),

CoT-MAE v2: Contextual Masked Auto-Encoder with Multi-view Modeling for Passage Retrieval,0.194958,"Growing techniques have been emerging to improve the performance of passage
retrieval. As an effective representation bottleneck pretraining technique, the
contextual masked auto-encoder utilizes contextual embedding to assist in the
reconstruction of passages. However, it only uses a single auto-encoding
pre-task for dense representation pre-training. This study brings multi-view
modeling to the contextual masked auto-encoder. Firstly, multi-view
representation utilizes both dense and sparse vectors as multi-view
representations, aiming to capture sentence semantics from different aspects.
Moreover, multiview decoding paradigm utilizes both autoencoding and
auto-regressive decoders in representation bottleneck pre-training, aiming to
provide both reconstructive and generative signals for better contextual
representation pretraining. We refer to this multi-view pretraining method as
CoT-MAE v2. Through extensive experiments, we show that CoT-MAE v2 is effective

Spatiotemporal Self-supervised Learning for Point Clouds in the Wild,0.910958,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has the potential to benefit many
applications, particularly those where manually annotating data is cumbersome.
One such situation is the semantic segmentation of point clouds. In this

In this paper, we introduce an SSL strategy that leverages positive pairs in
both the spatial and temporal domain. To this end, we design (i) a
point-to-cluster learning strategy that aggregates spatial information to
distinguish objects; and (ii) a cluster-to-cluster learning strategy based on
unsupervised object tracking that exploits temporal correspondences. We

On the Calibration and Uncertainty with Pólya-Gamma Augmentation for Dialog Retrieval Models,0.0826843,"Deep neural retrieval models have amply demonstrated their power but

Calibration of Quantum Decision Theory: Aversion to Large Losses and Predictability of Probabilistic Choices,0.173112,"We present the first calibration of quantum decision theory (QDT) to a
dataset of binary risky choice. We quantitatively account for the fraction of
choice reversals between two repetitions of the experiment, using a
probabilistic choice formulation in the simplest form without model assumption
or adjustable parameters. The prediction of choice reversal is then refined by
introducing heterogeneity between decision makers through their differentiation
into two groups: ``majoritarian'' and ``contrarian'' (in proportion 3:1). This
supports the first fundamental tenet of QDT, which models choice as an inherent
probabilistic process, where the probability of a prospect can be expressed as
the sum of its utility and attraction factors. We propose to parameterise the
utility factor with a stochastic version of cumulative prospect theory
(logit-CPT), and the attraction factor with a constant absolute risk aversion
(CARA) function. For this dataset, and penalising the larger number of QDT
parameters via the Wilks test of nested hypotheses, the QDT model is found to
perform significantly better than logit-CPT at both the aggregate and
individual levels, and for all considered fit criteria for the first experiment
iteration and for predictions (second ``out-of-sample'' iteration). The
distinctive QDT effect captured by the attraction factor is mostly appreciable
(i.e., most relevant and strongest in amplitude) for prospects with big losses.
Our quantitative analysis of the experimental results supports the existence of
an intrinsic limit of predictability, which is associated with the inherent
probabilistic nature of choice. The results of the paper can find applications
both in the prediction of choice of human decision makers as well as for
organizing the operation of artificial intelligence.",None,-1

supervised models may not align well with human intuitions: what models
consider as similar examples can be perceived as distinct by humans. As a
result, they have limited effectiveness in case-based decision support. In this
work, we incorporate ideas from metric learning with supervised learning to
examine the importance of alignment for effective decision support. In addition
to instance-level labels, we use human-provided triplet judgments to learn
human-compatible decision-focused representations. Using both synthetic data
and human subject experiments in multiple classification tasks, we demonstrate
that such representation is better aligned with human perception than
representation solely optimized for classification. Human-compatible
representations identify nearest neighbors that are perceived as more similar
by humans and allow humans to make more accurate predictions, leading to
substantial improvements in human decision accuracies (17.8% in butterfly vs.
moth classification and 13.2% in pneumonia classification).",None,-1
Occ3D: A Large-Scale 3D Occupancy Prediction Benchmark for Autonomous Driving,0.999872,"Robotic perception requires the modeling of both 3D geometry and semantics.
Existing methods typically focus on estimating 3D bounding boxes, neglecting

revealed that when not explicitly directed on which strategy should be adopted,
the LLM-driven agents primarily use the average strategy for consensus seeking

It learns an iterative denoising process to `denoise' random depth distribution

is performed in the latent space encoded by a dedicated depth encoder and
decoder. Instead of diffusing ground truth (GT) depth, the model learns to
reverse the process of diffusing the refined depth of itself into random depth

applying generative models to sparse GT depth scenarios. The proposed approach
benefits this task by refining depth estimation step by step, which is superior

Outlier detection using flexible categorisation and interrogative agendas,0.59811,"Categorization is one of the basic tasks in machine learning and data
analysis. Building on formal concept analysis (FCA), the starting point of the
present work is that different ways to categorize a given set of objects exist,

different such sets of features may yield better or worse categorizations,
relative to the task at hand. In their turn, the (a priori) choice of a
particular set of features over another might be subjective and express a
certain epistemic stance (e.g. interests, relevance, preferences) of an agent
or a group of agents, namely, their interrogative agenda. In the present paper,
we represent interrogative agendas as sets of features, and explore and compare
different ways to categorize objects w.r.t. different sets of features
(agendas). We first develop a simple unsupervised FCA-based algorithm for
outlier detection which uses categorizations arising from different agendas. We
then present a supervised meta-learning algorithm to learn suitable (fuzzy)
agendas for categorization as sets of features with different weights or
masses. We combine this meta-learning algorithm with the unsupervised outlier

radiance field. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIRF renders high-quality
novel views at a continuously-valued scale via volume rendering. Besides, we

Examining Autoexposure for Challenging Scenes,0.864665,"Autoexposure (AE) is a critical step applied by camera systems to ensure
properly exposed images. While current AE algorithms are effective in well-lit
environments with constant illumination, these algorithms still struggle in
environments with bright light sources or scenes with abrupt changes in
lighting. A significant hurdle in developing new AE algorithms for challenging
environments, especially those with time-varying lighting, is the lack of
suitable image datasets. To address this issue, we have captured a new 4D
exposure dataset that provides a large solution space (i.e., shutter speed
range from (1/500 to 15 seconds) over a temporal sequence with moving objects,
bright lights, and varying lighting. In addition, we have designed a software
platform to allow AE algorithms to be used in a plug-and-play manner with the
dataset. Our dataset and associate platform enable repeatable evaluation of
different AE algorithms and provide a much-needed starting point to develop
better AE methods. We examine several existing AE strategies using our dataset

lighting conditions.",None,-1
GameEval: Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games,0.701052,"The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have presented
challenges in evaluating those models. Existing evaluation methods are either
reference-based or preference based, which inevitably need human intervention
or introduce test bias caused by evaluator models. In this paper, we propose
GameEval, a novel approach to evaluating LLMs through goal-driven
conversational games, overcoming the limitations of previous methods. GameEval
treats LLMs as game players and assigns them distinct roles with specific goals
achieved by launching conversations of various forms, including discussion,
question answering, and voting. We design three unique games with cooperative
or adversarial objectives, accompanied by corresponding evaluation metrics, to
show how this new paradigm comprehensively evaluates model performance.Through
extensive experiments, we show that GameEval can effectively differentiate the
capabilities of various LLMs, providing a comprehensive assessment of their
integrated abilities to solve complex problems. Our public anonymous code is

ALDi: Quantifying the Arabic Level of Dialectness of Text,0.81652,"Transcribed speech and user-generated text in Arabic typically contain a
mixture of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the standardized language taught in
schools, and Dialectal Arabic (DA), used in daily communications. To handle
this variation, previous work in Arabic NLP has focused on Dialect
Identification (DI) on the sentence or the token level. However, DI treats the
task as binary, whereas we argue that Arabic speakers perceive a spectrum of
dialectness, which we operationalize at the sentence level as the Arabic Level
of Dialectness (ALDi), a continuous linguistic variable. We introduce the
AOC-ALDi dataset (derived from the AOC dataset), containing 127,835 sentences
(17% from news articles and 83% from user comments on those articles) which are
manually labeled with their level of dialectness. We provide a detailed
analysis of AOC-ALDi and show that a model trained on it can effectively
identify levels of dialectness on a range of other corpora (including dialects
and genres not included in AOC-ALDi), providing a more nuanced picture than
traditional DI systems. Through case studies, we illustrate how ALDi can reveal
Arabic speakers' stylistic choices in different situations, a useful property

Grounded Text-to-Image Synthesis with Attention Refocusing,0.905369,"Driven by the scalable diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets,
text-to-image synthesis methods have shown compelling results. However, these

given spatial layout during sampling. Creating the layouts manually requires
additional effort and can be tedious. Therefore, we explore using large
language models (LLM) to produce these layouts for our method. We conduct
extensive experiments on the DrawBench, HRS, and TIFA benchmarks to evaluate
our proposed method. We show that our proposed attention refocusing effectively

MeetEval: A Toolkit for Computation of Word Error Rates for Meeting Transcription Systems,0.736872,"MeetEval is an open-source toolkit to evaluate all kinds of meeting
transcription systems. It provides a unified interface for the computation of
commonly used Word Error Rates (WERs), specifically cpWER, ORC-WER and MIMO-WER
along other WER definitions. We extend the cpWER computation by a temporal
constraint to ensure that only words are identified as correct when the
temporal alignment is plausible. This leads to a better quality of the matching
of the hypothesis string to the reference string that more closely resembles
the actual transcription quality, and a system is penalized if it provides poor
time annotations. Since word-level timing information is often not available,
we present a way to approximate exact word-level timings from segment-level
timings (e.g., a sentence) and show that the approximation leads to a similar
WER as a matching with exact word-level annotations. At the same time, the time
constraint leads to a speedup of the matching algorithm, which outweighs the
additional overhead caused by processing the time stamps.",None,-1
Compositional preference models for aligning LMs,0.227535,"As language models (LMs) become more capable, it is increasingly important to
align them with human preferences. However, the dominant paradigm for training
Preference Models (PMs) for that purpose suffers from fundamental limitations,
such as lack of transparency and scalability, along with susceptibility to
overfitting the preference dataset. We propose Compositional Preference Models
(CPMs), a novel PM framework that decomposes one global preference assessment
into several interpretable features, obtains scalar scores for these features
from a prompted LM, and aggregates these scores using a logistic regression
classifier. Through these simple steps, CPMs allow to control which properties
of the preference data are used to train the preference model and to build it
based on features that are believed to underlie the human preference judgment.
Our experiments show that CPMs not only improve generalization and are more
robust to overoptimization than standard PMs, but also that best-of-n samples
obtained using CPMs tend to be preferred over samples obtained using
conventional PMs. Overall, our approach demonstrates the benefits of endowing
PMs with priors about which features determine human preferences while relying
on LM capabilities to extract those features in a scalable and robust way.",None,-1

Multi-Modal Evaluation Approach for Medical Image Segmentation,0.0768659,"Manual segmentation of medical images (e.g., segmenting tumors in CT scans)

Controllable Guide-Space for Generalizable Face Forgery Detection,0.813225,"Recent studies on face forgery detection have shown satisfactory performance
for methods involved in training datasets, but are not ideal enough for unknown

the generalization. In this paper, we propose a controllable guide-space (GS)
method to enhance the discrimination of different forgery domains, so as to
increase the forgery relevance of features and thereby improve the
generalization. The well-designed guide-space can simultaneously achieve both
the proper separation of forgery domains and the large distance between
real-forgery domains in an explicit and controllable manner. Moreover, for
better discrimination, we use a decoupling module to weaken the interference of
forgery-irrelevant correlations between domains. Furthermore, we make
adjustments to the decision boundary manifold according to the clustering
degree of the same domain features within the neighborhood. Extensive

Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Classifiers through Self-Attention and Relative Positioning Infusion,0.0687808,"Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging task for

Revisiting Token Dropping Strategy in Efficient BERT Pretraining,0.453476,"Token dropping is a recently-proposed strategy to speed up the pretraining of

semantic information in the representation space. Extensive experiments on 12
tasks show that, with the help of our ScTD, token dropping can achieve

Multi-modal Variational Autoencoders for normative modelling across multiple imaging modalities,0.649518,"One of the challenges of studying common neurological disorders is disease

Adversarial Clean Label Backdoor Attacks and Defenses on Text Classification Systems,0.387991,"Clean-label (CL) attack is a form of data poisoning attack where an adversary

Multi-Modal Mutual Attention and Iterative Interaction for Referring Image Segmentation,0.755187,"We address the problem of referring image segmentation that aims to generate
a mask for the object specified by a natural language expression. Many recent
works utilize Transformer to extract features for the target object by
aggregating the attended visual regions. However, the generic attention
mechanism in Transformer only uses the language input for attention weight
calculation, which does not explicitly fuse language features in its output.
Thus, its output feature is dominated by vision information, which limits the
model to comprehensively understand the multi-modal information, and brings
uncertainty for the subsequent mask decoder to extract the output mask. To
address this issue, we propose Multi-Modal Mutual Attention ($\mathrm{M^3Att}$)
and Multi-Modal Mutual Decoder ($\mathrm{M^3Dec}$) that better fuse information
from the two input modalities. Based on {$\mathrm{M^3Dec}$}, we further propose
Iterative Multi-modal Interaction ($\mathrm{IMI}$) to allow continuous and

and parallel children's stories in 350+ languages. MCS-350 can serve as a
benchmark for language identification of short texts and for 1400+ new
translation directions in low-resource Indian and African languages. Second, we
propose a novel misprediction-resolution hierarchical model, LIMIt, for
language identification that reduces error by 55% (from 0.71 to 0.32) on our
compiled children's stories dataset and by 40% (from 0.23 to 0.14) on the
FLORES-200 benchmark. Our method can expand language identification coverage
into low-resource languages by relying solely on systemic misprediction
patterns, bypassing the need to retrain large models from scratch.",None,-1
Examining Temporal Bias in Abusive Language Detection,0.196738,"The use of abusive language online has become an increasingly pervasive
problem that damages both individuals and society, with effects ranging from
psychological harm right through to escalation to real-life violence and even
death. Machine learning models have been developed to automatically detect
abusive language, but these models can suffer from temporal bias, the
phenomenon in which topics, language use or social norms change over time. This
study aims to investigate the nature and impact of temporal bias in abusive
language detection across various languages and explore mitigation methods. We
evaluate the performance of models on abusive data sets from different time
periods. Our results demonstrate that temporal bias is a significant challenge
for abusive language detection, with models trained on historical data showing
a significant drop in performance over time. We also present an extensive
linguistic analysis of these abusive data sets from a diachronic perspective,
aiming to explore the reasons for language evolution and performance decline.
This study sheds light on the pervasive issue of temporal bias in abusive
language detection across languages, offering crucial insights into language
evolution and temporal bias mitigation.",None,-1
SD-HuBERT: Sentence-Level Self-Distillation Induces Syllabic Organization in HuBERT,0.101349,"Data-driven unit discovery in self-supervised learning (SSL) of speech has
embarked on a new era of spoken language processing. Yet, the discovered units
often remain in phonetic space and the units beyond phonemes are largely
underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that a syllabic organization emerges in
learning sentence-level representation of speech. In particular, we adopt
""self-distillation"" objective to fine-tune the pretrained HuBERT with an
aggregator token that summarizes the entire sentence. Without any supervision,
the resulting model draws definite boundaries in speech, and the
representations across frames exhibit salient syllabic structures. We
demonstrate that this emergent structure largely corresponds to the ground
truth syllables. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark task, Spoken Speech
ABX, for evaluating sentence-level representation of speech. When compared to
previous models, our model outperforms in both unsupervised syllable discovery
and learning sentence-level representation. Together, we demonstrate that the
self-distillation of HuBERT gives rise to syllabic organization without relying

units for spoken language modeling.",None,-1
Cross-modal Place Recognition in Image Databases using Event-based Sensors,0.208087,"Visual place recognition is an important problem towards global localization

However, current event-based place recognition methods only rely on event
information, which restricts downstream applications of VPR. In this paper, we
present the first cross-modal visual place recognition framework that is
capable of retrieving regular images from a database given an event query. Our

Weakly-Supervised Scientific Document Classification via Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Stage Training,0.952331,"Scientific document classification is a critical task for a wide range of
applications, but the cost of obtaining massive amounts of human-labeled data

not appear in the document corpus, making it difficult to match labels and
documents precisely. To tackle this issue, we propose WANDER, which leverages
dense retrieval to perform matching in the embedding space to capture the
semantics of label names. We further design the label name expansion module to
enrich the label name representations. Lastly, a self-training step is used to
refine the predictions. The experiments on three datasets show that WANDER

Search for universal minimum drag resistance underwater vehicle hull using CFD,0.711708,"In Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) design, hull resistance is an

CoTDet: Affordance Knowledge Prompting for Task Driven Object Detection,0.612356,"Task driven object detection aims to detect object instances suitable for
affording a task in an image. Its challenge lies in object categories available
for the task being too diverse to be limited to a closed set of object
vocabulary for traditional object detection. Simply mapping categories and
visual features of common objects to the task cannot address the challenge. In
this paper, we propose to explore fundamental affordances rather than object
categories, i.e., common attributes that enable different objects to accomplish
the same task. Moreover, we propose a novel multi-level chain-of-thought
prompting (MLCoT) to extract the affordance knowledge from large language
models, which contains multi-level reasoning steps from task to object examples
to essential visual attributes with rationales. Furthermore, to fully exploit
knowledge to benefit object recognition and localization, we propose a
knowledge-conditional detection framework, namely CoTDet. It conditions the
detector from the knowledge to generate object queries and regress boxes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our CoTDet outperforms state-of-the-art

Concept Alignment as a Prerequisite for Value Alignment,0.201259,"Value alignment is essential for building AI systems that can safely and

agents need to align their representation of a situation with that of humans in
order to successfully align their values. Here, we formally analyze the concept
alignment problem in the inverse reinforcement learning setting, show how
neglecting concept alignment can lead to systematic value mis-alignment, and
describe an approach that helps minimize such failure modes by jointly
reasoning about a person's concepts and values. Additionally, we report

Biomedical Entity Linking with Triple-aware Pre-Training,0.432897,"Linking biomedical entities is an essential aspect in biomedical natural
language processing tasks, such as text mining and question answering. However,
a difficulty of linking the biomedical entities using current large language

semantic connection between different biomedical entities, which are useful in
identifying similar concepts in different textual contexts. To cope with
aforementioned problems, some recent works focused on injecting knowledge graph
information into LLMs. However, former methods either ignore the relational

phenomenon motivates us to extend the concept of multi-exit framework. Unlike
existing works mainly focusing on accuracy, our multi-exit framework is
fairness-oriented, where the internal classifiers are trained to be more
accurate and fairer. During inference, any instance with high confidence from

LM vs LM: Detecting Factual Errors via Cross Examination,0.834093,"A prominent weakness of modern language models (LMs) is their tendency to

by truth-seeking mechanisms in law, we propose a factuality evaluation
framework for LMs that is based on cross-examination. Our key idea is that an
incorrect claim is likely to result in inconsistency with other claims that the
model generates. To discover such inconsistencies, we facilitate a multi-turn
interaction between the LM that generated the claim and another LM (acting as
an examiner) which introduces questions to discover inconsistencies. We
empirically evaluate our method on factual claims made by multiple recent LMs

Partial Network Cloning,0.83801,"In this paper, we study a novel task that enables partial knowledge transfer

parametric ""cloning"" from a source network and then injects the cloned module

Improving Language Plasticity via Pretraining with Active Forgetting,0.237397,"Pretrained language models (PLMs) are today the primary model for natural

address this issue by learning a new embedding layer for the new language,
doing so is both data and compute inefficient. We propose to use an active
forgetting mechanism during pretraining, as a simple way of creating PLMs that
can quickly adapt to new languages. Concretely, by resetting the embedding
layer every K updates during pretraining, we encourage the PLM to improve its
ability of learning new embeddings within a limited number of updates, similar
to a meta-learning effect. Experiments with RoBERTa show that models pretrained
with our forgetting mechanism not only demonstrate faster convergence during

Semantic Compression With Large Language Models,0.485915,"The rise of large language models (LLMs) is revolutionizing information
retrieval, question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks.
However, in addition to confidently presenting factually inaccurate information
at times (known as ""hallucinations""), LLMs are also inherently limited by the
number of input and output tokens that can be processed at once, making them
potentially less effective on tasks that require processing a large set or
continuous stream of information. A common approach to reducing the size of
data is through lossless or lossy compression. Yet, in some cases it may not be
strictly necessary to perfectly recover every detail from the original data, as
long as a requisite level of semantic precision or intent is conveyed.

Robust estimation of exposure ratios in multi-exposure image stacks,0.396165,"Merging multi-exposure image stacks into a high dynamic range (HDR) image

which pixels are selected from pairs of exposures to minimize estimation error
caused by camera noise. When pixel values are represented in the logarithmic
domain, the problem can be solved efficiently using a linear solver. We
demonstrate that the estimation can be easily made robust to pixel misalignment
caused by camera or object motion by collecting pixels from multiple spatial

information on the Internet. This process requires a fact-checker to formulate
a search query based on the fact and to present it to a search engine. Then,
relevant and believable passages need to be identified in the search results
before a decision is made. This process is carried out by sub-editors at many
news and media organisations on a daily basis. Here, we ask the question as to
whether it is possible to automate the first step, that of query generation.
Can we automatically formulate search queries based on factual statements which
are similar to those formulated by human experts? Here, we consider similarity
both in terms of textual similarity and with respect to relevant documents
being returned by a search engine. First, we introduce a moderate-sized
evidence collection dataset which includes 390 factual statements together with
associated human-generated search queries and search results. Then, we
investigate generating queries using a number of rule-based and automatic text
generation methods based on pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We show
that these methods have different merits and propose a hybrid approach which
has superior performance in practice.",None,-1
Visualizing Skiers' Trajectories in Monocular Videos,0.0864937,"Trajectories are fundamental to winning in alpine skiing. Tools enabling the
analysis of such curves can enhance the training activity and enrich
broadcasting content. In this paper, we propose SkiTraVis, an algorithm to
visualize the sequence of points traversed by a skier during its performance.
SkiTraVis works on monocular videos and constitutes a pipeline of a visual
tracker to model the skier's motion and of a frame correspondence module to
estimate the camera's motion. The separation of the two motions enables the
visualization of the trajectory according to the moving camera's perspective.

A Universal Question-Answering Platform for Knowledge Graphs,0.546348,"Knowledge from diverse application domains is organized as knowledge graphs
(KGs) that are stored in RDF engines accessible in the web via SPARQL
endpoints. Expressing a well-formed SPARQL query requires information about the
graph structure and the exact URIs of its components, which is impractical for
the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural
language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on
application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information,
expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG. Therefore,
they are hard to generalize to a broad set of applications and KGs.
  In this paper, we propose KGQAn, a universal QA system that does not need to
be tailored to each target KG. Instead of curated rules, KGQAn introduces a
novel formalization of question understanding as a text generation problem to
convert a question into an intermediate abstract representation via a neural
sequence-to-sequence model. We also develop a just-in-time linker that maps at
query time the abstract representation to a SPARQL query for a specific KG,
using only the publicly accessible APIs and the existing indices of the RDF
store, without requiring any pre-processing. Our experiments with several real
KGs demonstrate that KGQAn is easily deployed and outperforms by a large margin
the state-of-the-art in terms of quality of answers and processing time,
especially for arbitrary KGs, unseen during the training.",None,-1
Confucius: Iterative Tool Learning from Introspection Feedback by Easy-to-Difficult Curriculum,0.487255,"Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a
promising approach to extending the capability of LLMs. Although some works
employ open-source LLMs for the tool learning task, most of them are trained in
a controlled environment in which LLMs only learn to execute the human-provided
tools. However, selecting proper tools from the large toolset is also a crucial
ability for the tool learning model to be applied in real-world applications.
Existing methods usually directly employ self-instruction methods to train the
model, which ignores differences in tool complexity. In this paper, we propose
the Confucius, a novel tool learning framework to train LLM to use complicated
tools in real-world scenarios, which contains two main phases: (1) We first
propose a multi-stage learning method to teach the LLM to use various tools
from an easy-to-difficult curriculum; (2) thenceforth, we propose the Iterative
Self-instruct from Introspective Feedback (ISIF) to dynamically construct the

Towards Informative Few-Shot Prompt with Maximum Information Gain for In-Context Learning,0.25845,"Large Language models (LLMs) possess the capability to engage In-context
Learning (ICL) by leveraging a few demonstrations pertaining to a new

factors are held constant, the random selection of examples still results in
high variance. Consequently, we aim to explore the informative ability of data
examples by quantifying the Information Gain (IG) obtained in prediction after
observing a given example candidate. Then we propose to sample those with
maximum IG. Additionally, we identify the presence of template bias, which can
lead to unfair evaluations of IG during the sampling process. To mitigate this

PUPS: Point Cloud Unified Panoptic Segmentation,0.805893,"Point cloud panoptic segmentation is a challenging task that seeks a holistic
solution for both semantic and instance segmentation to predict groupings of
coherent points. Previous approaches treat semantic and instance segmentation

the instance segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple but
effective point cloud unified panoptic segmentation (PUPS) framework, which use
a set of point-level classifiers to directly predict semantic and instance
groupings in an end-to-end manner. To realize PUPS, we introduce bipartite
matching to our training pipeline so that our classifiers are able to
exclusively predict groupings of instances, getting rid of hand-crafted
designs, e.g. anchors and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). In order to achieve
better grouping results, we utilize a transformer decoder to iteratively refine

A Conditional Generative Chatbot using Transformer Model,0.033864,"A Chatbot serves as a communication tool between a human user and a machine
to achieve an appropriate answer based on the human input. In more recent
approaches, a combination of Natural Language Processing and sequential models

their sequential nature, which leads to less accurate results. To tackle this

Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks and a transformer model for answer
generation in Chatbots. While the generator of the proposed model consists of a

Did You Read the Instructions? Rethinking the Effectiveness of Task Definitions in Instruction Learning,0.697368,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in following
natural language instructions to solve unseen tasks. However, it remains

ablation analysis informed by human annotations to understand which parts of a
task definition are most important, and find that model performance only drops
substantially when removing contents describing the task output, in particular
label information. Next, we propose an automatic algorithm to compress task
definitions to a minimal supporting set of tokens, and find that 60\% of tokens

these results, we propose two strategies to help models better leverage task
instructions: (1) providing only key information for tasks in a common

the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main
contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks
have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior,

Context Matters: A Strategy to Pre-train Language Model for Science Education,0.933014,"This study aims at improving the performance of scoring student responses in
science education automatically. BERT-based language models have shown

Dynamic Transformers Provide a False Sense of Efficiency,0.146577,"Despite much success in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained

DarkVisionNet: Low-Light Imaging via RGB-NIR Fusion with Deep Inconsistency Prior,0.904193,"RGB-NIR fusion is a promising method for low-light imaging. However,
high-intensity noise in low-light images amplifies the effect of structure
inconsistency between RGB-NIR images, which fails existing algorithms. To
handle this, we propose a new RGB-NIR fusion algorithm called Dark Vision Net
(DVN) with two technical novelties: Deep Structure and Deep Inconsistency Prior
(DIP). The Deep Structure extracts clear structure details in deep multiscale
feature space rather than raw input space, which is more robust to noisy
inputs. Based on the deep structures from both RGB and NIR domains, we
introduce the DIP to leverage the structure inconsistency to guide the fusion
of RGB-NIR. Benefiting from this, the proposed DVN obtains high-quality
lowlight images without the visual artifacts. We also propose a new dataset
called Dark Vision Dataset (DVD), consisting of aligned RGB-NIR image pairs, as
the first public RGBNIR fusion benchmark. Quantitative and qualitative results
on the proposed benchmark show that DVN significantly outperforms other
comparison algorithms in PSNR and SSIM, especially in extremely low light

Unsupervised Meta-Learning via Few-shot Pseudo-supervised Contrastive Learning,0.527867,"Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn generalizable knowledge across a
distribution of tasks constructed from unlabeled data. Here, the main challenge
is how to construct diverse tasks for meta-learning without label information;
recent works have proposed to create, e.g., pseudo-labeling via pretrained
representations or creating synthetic samples via generative models. However,
such a task construction strategy is fundamentally limited due to heavy
reliance on the immutable pseudo-labels during meta-learning and the quality of
the representations or the generated samples. To overcome the limitations, we
propose a simple yet effective unsupervised meta-learning framework, coined
Pseudo-supervised Contrast (PsCo), for few-shot classification. We are inspired
by the recent self-supervised learning literature; PsCo utilizes a momentum
network and a queue of previous batches to improve pseudo-labeling and
construct diverse tasks in a progressive manner. Our extensive experiments

SIO: Synthetic In-Distribution Data Benefits Out-of-Distribution Detection,0.147791,"Building up reliable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detectors is challenging,
often requiring the use of OOD data during training. In this work, we develop a
data-driven approach which is distinct and complementary to existing works:
Instead of using external OOD data, we fully exploit the internal

additional synthetic ID images. The classifier is then trained using a novel

Synapse: Trajectory-as-Exemplar Prompting with Memory for Computer Control,0.794954,"Building agents with large language models (LLMs) for computer control is a
burgeoning research area, where the agent receives computer states and performs
actions to complete complex tasks. Previous computer agents have demonstrated
the benefits of in-context learning (ICL); however, their performance is
hindered by several issues. First, the limited context length of LLMs and
complex computer states restrict the number of exemplars, as a single webpage
can consume the entire context. Second, the exemplars in current methods, such
as high-level plans and multi-choice questions, cannot represent complete
trajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third,
existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook the
similarity among tasks, resulting in poor generalization to novel tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce Synapse, a computer agent featuring
three key components: i) state abstraction, which filters out task-irrelevant
information from raw states, allowing more exemplars within the limited
context, ii) trajectory-as-exemplar prompting, which prompts the LLM with
complete trajectories of the abstracted states and actions to improve
multi-step decision-making, and iii) exemplar memory, which stores the
embeddings of exemplars and retrieves them via similarity search for
generalization to novel tasks. We evaluate Synapse on MiniWoB++, a standard
task suite, and Mind2Web, a real-world website benchmark. In MiniWoB++, Synapse
achieves a 99.2% average success rate (a 10% relative improvement) across 64

Emergence of Adaptive Circadian Rhythms in Deep Reinforcement Learning,0.541887,"Adapting to regularities of the environment is critical for biological

little-to-no relation to the downstream task. We evaluate our method in
standard and extended MSTAR operating conditions and find it to achieve high

OPE-SR: Orthogonal Position Encoding for Designing a Parameter-free Upsampling Module in Arbitrary-scale Image Super-Resolution,0.624222,"Implicit neural representation (INR) is a popular approach for
arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR), as a key component of INR,

upsampling module for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution. Same as INR, our
OPE-Upscale Module takes 2D coordinates and latent code as inputs; however it
does not require training parameters. This parameter-free feature allows the
OPE-Upscale Module to directly perform linear combination operations to
reconstruct an image in a continuous manner, achieving an arbitrary-scale image

Weakly Supervised Monocular 3D Object Detection using Multi-View Projection and Direction Consistency,0.673689,"Monocular 3D object detection has become a mainstream approach in automatic

Prompter: Zero-shot Adaptive Prefixes for Dialogue State Tracking Domain Adaptation,0.275396,"A challenge in the Dialogue State Tracking (DST) field is adapting models to

zero-shot scenarios, as it is not clear how to apply it unsupervisedly.
  Our method, Prompter, uses descriptions of target domain slots to generate
dynamic prefixes that are concatenated to the key and values at each layer's
self-attention mechanism. This allows for the use of prefix-tuning in
zero-shot. Prompter outperforms previous methods on both the MultiWOZ and SGD

Incorporating Transformer Designs into Convolutions for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution,0.32162,"In recent years, the use of large convolutional kernels has become popular in
designing convolutional neural networks due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and provide large receptive fields. However, the
increase in kernel size also leads to a quadratic growth in the number of

this challenge, we propose a neighborhood attention (NA) module that upgrades
the standard convolution with a self-attention mechanism. The NA module
efficiently extracts long-range dependencies in a sliding window pattern,
thereby achieving similar performance to large convolutional kernels but with
fewer parameters.
  Building upon the NA module, we propose a lightweight single image
super-resolution (SISR) network named TCSR. Additionally, we introduce an
enhanced feed-forward network (EFFN) in TCSR to improve the SISR performance.

ColonMapper: topological mapping and localization for colonoscopy,0.0883493,"We propose a topological mapping and localization system able to operate on
real human colonoscopies, despite significant shape and illumination changes.
The map is a graph where each node codes a colon location by a set of real

The ECE task is more challenging since each event can contain multiple event

TBFormer: Two-Branch Transformer for Image Forgery Localization,0.566443,"Image forgery localization aims to identify forged regions by capturing
subtle traces from high-quality discriminative features. In this paper, we

taking advantage of the discriminative stacked Transformer layers, for both RGB

Fusion Module (AHFM) is proposed to effectively fuse hierarchical features from
two different domains. Although the two feature extraction branches have the
same architecture, their features have significant differences since they are
extracted from different domains. We adopt position attention to embed them
into a unified feature domain for hierarchical feature investigation. Finally,
a Transformer decoder is constructed for feature reconstruction to generate the

Relevance Feedback with Brain Signals,0.562997,"The Relevance Feedback (RF) process relies on accurate and real-time
relevance estimation of feedback documents to improve retrieval performance.
Since collecting explicit relevance annotations imposes an extra burden on the
user, extensive studies have explored using pseudo-relevance signals and
implicit feedback signals as substitutes. However, such signals are indirect
indicators of relevance and suffer from complex search scenarios where user
interactions are absent or biased.
  Recently, the advances in portable and high-precision brain-computer
interface (BCI) devices have shown the possibility to monitor user's brain
activities during search process. Brain signals can directly reflect user's
psychological responses to search results and thus it can act as additional and
unbiased RF signals. To explore the effectiveness of brain signals in the
context of RF, we propose a novel RF framework that combines BCI-based
relevance feedback with pseudo-relevance signals and implicit signals to
improve the performance of document re-ranking. The experimental results on the
user study dataset show that incorporating brain signals leads to significant
performance improvement in our RF framework. Besides, we observe that brain
signals perform particularly well in several hard search scenarios, especially
when implicit signals as feedback are missing or noisy. This reveals when and
how to exploit brain signals in the context of RF.",None,-1
SwinDocSegmenter: An End-to-End Unified Domain Adaptive Transformer for Document Instance Segmentation,0.734345,"Instance-level segmentation of documents consists in assigning a class-aware

Retrieval-Generation Alignment for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue System,0.446333,"Developing an efficient retriever to retrieve knowledge from a large-scale

Extensions to Generalized Annotated Logic and an Equivalent Neural Architecture,0.269404,"While deep neural networks have led to major advances in image recognition,

Reconstructing Groups of People with Hypergraph Relational Reasoning,0.574279,"Due to the mutual occlusion, severe scale variation, and complex spatial

Fairness in Visual Clustering: A Novel Transformer Clustering Approach,0.854114,"Promoting fairness for deep clustering models in unsupervised clustering

a novel loss function is introduced to encourage a purity consistency for all
clusters to maintain the fairness aspect of the learned clustering model.
Moreover, we present a novel attention mechanism, Cross-attention, to measure

Semi-supervised Hand Appearance Recovery via Structure Disentanglement and Dual Adversarial Discrimination,0.621822,"Enormous hand images with reliable annotations are collected through

Choose your Data Wisely: A Framework for Semantic Counterfactuals,0.313124,"Counterfactual explanations have been argued to be one of the most intuitive

to 20 points in the tasks of text classification and relation extraction.
Increasing h-adversarials beyond this range can result in performance plateaus

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing,0.85635,"This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based

RBSR: Efficient and Flexible Recurrent Network for Burst Super-Resolution,0.414735,"Burst super-resolution (BurstSR) aims at reconstructing a high-resolution
(HR) image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) and noisy images, which is
conducive to enhancing the imaging effects of smartphones with limited sensors.
The main challenge of BurstSR is to effectively combine the complementary
information from input frames, while existing methods still struggle with it.
In this paper, we suggest fusing cues frame-by-frame with an efficient and
flexible recurrent network. In particular, we emphasize the role of the
base-frame and utilize it as a key prompt to guide the knowledge acquisition
from other frames in every recurrence. Moreover, we introduce an implicit

Improving neural network representations using human similarity judgments,0.66225,"Deep neural networks have reached human-level performance on many computer
vision tasks. However, the objectives used to train these networks enforce only
that similar images are embedded at similar locations in the representation
space, and do not directly constrain the global structure of the resulting
space. Here, we explore the impact of supervising this global structure by
linearly aligning it with human similarity judgments. We find that a naive
approach leads to large changes in local representational structure that harm
downstream performance. Thus, we propose a novel method that aligns the global
structure of representations while preserving their local structure. This
global-local transform considerably improves accuracy across a variety of
few-shot learning and anomaly detection tasks. Our results indicate that human
visual representations are globally organized in a way that facilitates
learning from few examples, and incorporating this global structure into neural
network representations improves performance on downstream tasks.",None,-1
M2C: Towards Automatic Multimodal Manga Complement,0.461898,"Multimodal manga analysis focuses on enhancing manga understanding with
visual and textual features, which has attracted considerable attention from

What does BERT learn about prosody?,0.51502,"Language models have become nearly ubiquitous in natural language processing
applications achieving state-of-the-art results in many tasks including
prosody. As the model design does not define predetermined linguistic targets
during training but rather aims at learning generalized representations of the
language, analyzing and interpreting the representations that models implicitly
capture is important in bridging the gap between interpretability and model
performance. Several studies have explored the linguistic information that
models capture providing some insights on their representational capacity.
However, the current studies have not explored whether prosody is part of the
structural information of the language that models learn. In this work, we
perform a series of experiments on BERT probing the representations captured at
different layers. Our results show that information about prosodic prominence
spans across many layers but is mostly focused in middle layers suggesting that
BERT relies mostly on syntactic and semantic information.",None,-1

SwinLSTM:Improving Spatiotemporal Prediction Accuracy using Swin Transformer and LSTM,0.92149,"Integrating CNNs and RNNs to capture spatiotemporal dependencies is a

Parameter-efficient Modularised Bias Mitigation via AdapterFusion,0.857569,"Large pre-trained language models contain societal biases and carry along
these biases to downstream tasks. Current in-processing bias mitigation

bias mitigation functionalities into separate adapters, and then add them to
the model on-demand in order to deliver fairness qualities. We conduct a large
set of experiments on three classification tasks with gender, race, and age as

Enhancing Explainability in Mobility Data Science through a combination of methods,0.473248,"In the domain of Mobility Data Science, the intricate task of interpreting
models trained on trajectory data, and elucidating the spatio-temporal movement

3D Medical Image Segmentation with Sparse Annotation via Cross-Teaching between 3D and 2D Networks,0.341965,"Medical image segmentation typically necessitates a large and precisely

On Evaluating Multilingual Compositional Generalization with Translated Datasets,0.341653,"Compositional generalization allows efficient learning and human-like
inductive biases. Since most research investigating compositional
generalization in NLP is done on English, important questions remain
underexplored. Do the necessary compositional generalization abilities differ
across languages? Can models compositionally generalize cross-lingually? As a
first step to answering these questions, recent work used neural machine
translation to translate datasets for evaluating compositional generalization
in semantic parsing. However, we show that this entails critical semantic
distortion. To address this limitation, we craft a faithful rule-based
translation of the MCWQ dataset from English to Chinese and Japanese. Even with
the resulting robust benchmark, which we call MCWQ-R, we show that the
distribution of compositions still suffers due to linguistic divergences, and
that multilingual models still struggle with cross-lingual compositional
generalization. Our dataset and methodology will be useful resources for the
study of cross-lingual compositional generalization in other tasks.",None,-1
DoE2Vec: Deep-learning Based Features for Exploratory Landscape Analysis,0.797644,"We propose DoE2Vec, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methodology to

high dimensional search spaces. For validation, we inspect the quality of

FLAG: Fast Label-Adaptive Aggregation for Multi-label Classification in Federated Learning,0.113842,"Federated learning aims to share private data to maximize the data utility
without privacy leakage. Previous federated learning research mainly focuses on
multi-class classification problems. However, multi-label classification is a
crucial research problem close to real-world data properties. Nevertheless, a

Existing studies of multi-label federated learning did not consider the
characteristics of multi-label data, i.e., they used the concept of multi-class
classification to verify their methods' performance, which means it will not be
feasible to apply their methods to real-world applications. Therefore, this

Clustering-based Multi-label Data Allocation (CMDA) and a novel aggregation
method, Fast Label-Adaptive Aggregation (FLAG), for multi-label classification

Vanishing Activations: A Symptom of Deep Capsule Networks,0.168993,"Capsule Networks, an extension to Neural Networks utilizing vector or matrix
representations instead of scalars, were initially developed to create a
dynamic parse tree where visual concepts evolve from parts to complete objects.

revealed shortcomings in the original Capsule Network architecture, notably its
failure to construct a parse tree and its susceptibility to vanishing gradients
when deployed in deeper networks. This paper extends the investigation to a
range of leading Capsule Network architectures, demonstrating that these issues
are not confined to the original design. We argue that the majority of Capsule
Network research has produced architectures that, while modestly divergent from

IC3: Image Captioning by Committee Consensus,0.335542,"If you ask a human to describe an image, they might do so in a thousand

RPTQ: Reorder-based Post-training Quantization for Large Language Models,0.915786,"Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance,
but their deployment presents challenges due to their significant memory usage.

challenge, we introduce a quantization method called RPTQ, which utilizes a
reorder-based approach. By rearranging the channels and quantizing them in
clusters, RPTQ effectively mitigates the impact of range differences between
channels. To minimize the overhead of the reorder operation, we fuse it into
the layer norm operation and weights in linear layers. In our experiments, RPTQ
achieved a significant breakthrough by utilizing 3-bit activation in LLMs for
the first time, resulting in a substantial reduction in memory usage. For

combines the semantics learned by the two encoders, enabling the fusion of
multiple perspectives and facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of

Online POMDP Planning with Anytime Deterministic Guarantees,0.814804,"Autonomous agents operating in real-world scenarios frequently encounter
uncertainty and make decisions based on incomplete information. Planning under
uncertainty can be mathematically formalized using partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). However, finding an optimal plan for POMDPs can be
computationally expensive and is feasible only for small tasks. In recent
years, approximate algorithms, such as tree search and sample-based
methodologies, have emerged as state-of-the-art POMDP solvers for larger
problems. Despite their effectiveness, these algorithms offer only
probabilistic and often asymptotic guarantees toward the optimal solution due
to their dependence on sampling. To address these limitations, we derive a
deterministic relationship between a simplified solution that is easier to
obtain and the theoretically optimal one. First, we derive bounds for selecting
a subset of the observations to branch from while computing a complete belief
at each posterior node. Then, since a complete belief update may be
computationally demanding, we extend the bounds to support reduction of both
the state and the observation spaces. We demonstrate how our guarantees can be

SMPConv: Self-moving Point Representations for Continuous Convolution,0.758071,"Continuous convolution has recently gained prominence due to its ability to

Removing RLHF Protections in GPT-4 via Fine-Tuning,0.837009,"As large language models (LLMs) have increased in their capabilities, so does

Enhancing Fine-Tuning Based Backdoor Defense with Sharpness-Aware Minimization,0.843981,"Backdoor defense, which aims to detect or mitigate the effect of malicious

performance on model compression tasks, however, it is hard to explain how the
knowledge they transferred helps to improve the performance of the student
network. In this work, we focus on proposing a knowledge distillation method
that has both high interpretability and competitive performance. We first
revisit the structure of mainstream CNN models and reveal that possessing the
capacity of identifying class discriminative regions of input is critical for
CNN to perform classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this capacity
can be obtained and enhanced by transferring class activation maps. Based on
our findings, we propose class attention transfer based knowledge distillation
(CAT-KD). Different from previous KD methods, we explore and present several
properties of the knowledge transferred by our method, which not only improve
the interpretability of CAT-KD but also contribute to a better understanding of
CNN. While having high interpretability, CAT-KD achieves state-of-the-art

Learning in Cooperative Multiagent Systems Using Cognitive and Machine Models,0.538971,"Developing effective Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is critical for many
applications requiring collaboration and coordination with humans. Despite the
rapid advance of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) in cooperative
MAS, one major challenge is the simultaneous learning and interaction of
independent agents in dynamic environments in the presence of stochastic
rewards. State-of-the-art MADRL models struggle to perform well in Coordinated
Multi-agent Object Transportation Problems (CMOTPs), wherein agents must
coordinate with each other and learn from stochastic rewards. In contrast,
humans often learn rapidly to adapt to nonstationary environments that require
coordination among people. In this paper, motivated by the demonstrated ability
of cognitive models based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) to capture
human decisions in many dynamic decision making tasks, we propose three
variants of Multi-Agent IBL models (MAIBL). The idea of these MAIBL algorithms
is to combine the cognitive mechanisms of IBLT and the techniques of MADRL
models to deal with coordination MAS in stochastic environments from the
perspective of independent learners. We demonstrate that the MAIBL models
exhibit faster learning and achieve better coordination in a dynamic CMOTP task
with various settings of stochastic rewards compared to current MADRL models.
We discuss the benefits of integrating cognitive insights into MADRL models.",None,-1
AutoTrial: Prompting Language Models for Clinical Trial Design,0.627051,"Clinical trials are critical for drug development. Constructing the
appropriate eligibility criteria (i.e., the inclusion/exclusion criteria for

knowledge incorporation via in-context learning, and (3) explicit reasoning
chains to provide rationales for understanding the outputs. Experiments on over
70K clinical trials verify that AutoTrial generates high-quality criteria texts

"Point-Query Quadtree for Crowd Counting, Localization, and More",0.823747,"We show that crowd counting can be viewed as a decomposable point querying
process. This formulation enables arbitrary points as input and jointly reasons
whether the points are crowd and where they locate. The querying processing,
however, raises an underlying problem on the number of necessary querying
points. Too few imply underestimation; too many increase computational
overhead. To address this dilemma, we introduce a decomposable structure, i.e.,
the point-query quadtree, and propose a new counting model, termed Point quEry
Transformer (PET). PET implements decomposable point querying via
data-dependent quadtree splitting, where each querying point could split into
four new points when necessary, thus enabling dynamic processing of sparse and
dense regions. Such a querying process yields an intuitive, universal modeling
of crowd as both the input and output are interpretable and steerable. We
demonstrate the applications of PET on a number of crowd-related tasks,
including fully-supervised crowd counting and localization, partial annotation
learning, and point annotation refinement, and also report state-of-the-art

Understanding Expressivity of GNN in Rule Learning,0.318264,"Rule learning is critical to improving knowledge graph (KG) reasoning due to

Deformation measurement of a soil mixing retaining wall using terrestrial laser scanning,0.49269,"Retaining walls are often built to prevent excessive lateral movements of the
ground surrounding an excavation site. During an excavation, failure of
retaining walls could cause catastrophic accidents and hence their lateral
deformations are monitored regularly. Laser scanning can rapidly acquire the
spatial data of a relatively large area at fine spatial resolutions, which is
ideal for monitoring retaining walls' deformations. This paper attempts to
apply laser scanning to measurements of the lateral deformations of a soil
mixing retaining wall at an ongoing excavation site. Reference measurements by
total station and inclinometer were also conducted to verify those from the
laser scanning. The deformations derived using laser scanning data were
consistent with the reference measurements at the top part of the retaining

estimation method on the research data.",None,-1
Rigorously Assessing Natural Language Explanations of Neurons,0.840006,"Natural language is an appealing medium for explaining how large language

claims that a neuron $a$ activates on all and only input strings that refer to
a concept picked out by the proposed explanation $E$. In the intervention mode,
we construe $E$ as a claim that the neuron $a$ is a causal mediator of the
concept denoted by $E$. We apply our framework to the GPT-4-generated

Ontology Revision based on Pre-trained Language Models,0.42607,"Ontology revision aims to seamlessly incorporate a new ontology into an
existing ontology and plays a crucial role in tasks such as ontology evolution,
ontology maintenance, and ontology alignment. Similar to repair single
ontologies, resolving logical incoherence in the task of ontology revision is
also important and meaningful, because incoherence is a main potential factor
to cause inconsistency and reasoning with an inconsistent ontology will obtain
meaningless answers.To deal with this problem, various ontology revision
approaches have been proposed to define revision operators and design ranking
strategies for axioms in an ontology. However, they rarely consider axiom
semantics which provides important information to differentiate axioms. In
addition, pre-trained models can be utilized to encode axiom semantics, and
have been widely applied in many natural language processing tasks and
ontology-related ones in recent years.Therefore, in this paper, we study how to
apply pre-trained models to revise ontologies. We first define four scoring
functions to rank axioms based on a pre-trained model by considering various
information from an ontology. Based on the functions, an ontology revision
algorithm is then proposed to deal with unsatisfiable concepts at once. To
improve efficiency, an adapted revision algorithm is designed to deal with

diverse range of domains, making it challenging for human experts to analyze

individual predictions. Considering the relevance score, we then generate
explanations by visualizing relevant words for the predicted patent class.
Experimental results on two datasets comprising two-million patent texts

Neural Polarizer: A Lightweight and Effective Backdoor Defense via Purifying Poisoned Features,0.831646,"Recent studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of deep neural networks
to backdoor attacks. Given a backdoored model, its prediction of a poisoned

particular polarizations while filtering light waves with other polarizations,
we propose a novel backdoor defense method by inserting a learnable neural
polarizer into the backdoored model as an intermediate layer, in order to
purify the poisoned sample via filtering trigger information while maintaining
benign information. The neural polarizer is instantiated as one lightweight
linear transformation layer, which is learned through solving a well designed
bi-level optimization problem, based on a limited clean dataset. Compared to
other fine-tuning-based defense methods which often adjust all parameters of
the backdoored model, the proposed method only needs to learn one additional

Using Text Injection to Improve Recognition of Personal Identifiers in Speech,0.678188,"Accurate recognition of specific categories, such as persons' names, dates or

Difference of Probability and Information Entropy for Skills Classification and Prediction in Student Learning,0.0261916,"The probability of an event is in the range of [0, 1]. In a sample space S,

the standard implementation of knowledge distillation only achieves marginal
improvements due to severe overfitting. The further quantitative analyses
demonstrate the reason that the standard knowledge distillation exhibits a
relatively large variance of the teacher model's logits due to the essence of
contrastive learning. To mitigate the issue induced by high variance, this

A Novel Energy based Model Mechanism for Multi-modal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,0.371938,"Multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) has recently attracted
increasing attention. The span-based extraction methods, such as FSUIE,
demonstrate strong performance in sentiment analysis due to their joint
modeling of input sequences and target labels. However, previous methods still
have certain limitations: (i) They ignore the difference in the focus of visual
information between different analysis targets (aspect or sentiment). (ii)
Combining features from uni-modal encoders directly may not be sufficient to
eliminate the modal gap and can cause difficulties in capturing the image-text
pairwise relevance. (iii) Existing span-based methods for MABSA ignore the
pairwise relevance of target span boundaries. To tackle these limitations, we

Specifically, our model contains a Prompt as Dual Query (PDQ) module that uses
the prompt as both a visual query and a language query to extract prompt-aware
visual information and strengthen the pairwise relevance between visual
information and the analysis target. Additionally, we introduce an Energy-based
Pairwise Expert (EPE) module that models the boundaries pairing of the analysis

Multi-Mode Online Knowledge Distillation for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning,0.685959,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made remarkable progress in visual
representation learning. Some studies combine SSL with knowledge distillation

existing SSL-KD methods that transfer knowledge from a static pre-trained
teacher to a student, in MOKD, two different models learn collaboratively in a
self-supervised manner. Specifically, MOKD consists of two distillation modes:
self-distillation and cross-distillation modes. Among them, self-distillation
performs self-supervised learning for each model independently, while
cross-distillation realizes knowledge interaction between different models. In
cross-distillation, a cross-attention feature search strategy is proposed to
enhance the semantic feature alignment between different models. As a result,
the two models can absorb knowledge from each other to boost their

PECAN: Leveraging Policy Ensemble for Context-Aware Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination,0.423924,"Zero-shot human-AI coordination holds the promise of collaborating with
humans without human data. Prevailing methods try to train the ego agent with a
population of partners via self-play. However, these methods suffer from two
problems: 1) The diversity of a population with finite partners is limited,
thereby limiting the capacity of the trained ego agent to collaborate with a
novel human; 2) Current methods only provide a common best response for every
partner in the population, which may result in poor zero-shot coordination
performance with a novel partner or humans. To address these issues, we first
propose the policy ensemble method to increase the diversity of partners in the
population, and then develop a context-aware method enabling the ego agent to
analyze and identify the partner's potential policy primitives so that it can
take different actions accordingly. In this way, the ego agent is able to learn
more universal cooperative behaviors for collaborating with diverse partners.
We conduct experiments on the Overcooked environment, and evaluate the

Chinese Spelling Correction as Rephrasing Language Model,0.75813,"This paper studies Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC), which aims to detect

learning process results in the bottleneck of generalizability and
transferability of machine spelling correction. To address this, we propose

QVRF: A Quantization-error-aware Variable Rate Framework for Learned Image Compression,0.303119,"Learned image compression has exhibited promising compression performance,
but variable bitrates over a wide range remain a challenge. State-of-the-art
variable rate methods compromise the loss of model performance and require
numerous additional parameters. In this paper, we present a
Quantization-error-aware Variable Rate Framework (QVRF) that utilizes a
univariate quantization regulator a to achieve wide-range variable rates within
a single model. Specifically, QVRF defines a quantization regulator vector
coupled with predefined Lagrange multipliers to control quantization error of
all latent representation for discrete variable rates. Additionally, the
reparameterization method makes QVRF compatible with a round quantizer.
Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that existing fixed-rate VAE-based methods
equipped with QVRF can achieve wide-range continuous variable rates within a
single model without significant performance degradation. Furthermore, QVRF
outperforms contemporary variable-rate methods in rate-distortion performance
with minimal additional parameters.",None,-1
Quantifying Consistency and Information Loss for Causal Abstraction Learning,0.345791,"Structural causal models provide a formalism to express causal relations
between variables of interest. Models and variables can represent a system at
different levels of abstraction, whereby relations may be coarsened and refined
according to the need of a modeller. However, switching between different
levels of abstraction requires evaluating a trade-off between the consistency
and the information loss among different models. In this paper we introduce a
family of interventional measures that an agent may use to evaluate such a
trade-off. We consider four measures suited for different tasks, analyze their
properties, and propose algorithms to evaluate and learn causal abstractions.
Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of our setup by empirically showing how
different measures and algorithmic choices may lead to different abstractions.",None,-1
Internal-External Boundary Attention Fusion for Glass Surface Segmentation,0.623397,"Glass surfaces of transparent objects and mirrors are not able to be uniquely

surface boundary where the transition of visual appearances between glass and
non-glass surfaces are observed. In this work, we analytically investigate how
glass surface boundary helps to characterize glass objects. Inspired by prior
semantic segmentation approaches with challenging image types such as X-ray or
CT scans, we propose separated internal-external boundary attention modules

Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration,0.392907,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have

task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse
collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which
collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and
reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic
approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming
hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments
across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better
performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis

among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.",None,-1
In-context Learning and Gradient Descent Revisited,0.216296,"In-context learning (ICL) has shown impressive results in few-shot learning

simplified settings, where the parameters of a shallow model are optimized. In

and insufficient baselines. We show that surprisingly, even untrained models
achieve comparable ICL-GD similarity scores despite not exhibiting ICL. Next,
we explore a major discrepancy in the flow of information throughout the model

LLM Censorship: A Machine Learning Challenge or a Computer Security Problem?,0.230168,"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in
comprehending complex instructions. However, their blind adherence to provided

Commonly employed censorship approaches treat the issue as a machine learning

this paper, we present the theoretical limitations of such semantic censorship
approaches. Specifically, we demonstrate that semantic censorship can be
perceived as an undecidable problem, highlighting the inherent challenges in
censorship that arise due to LLMs' programmatic and instruction-following

Generalization of Fitness Exercise Recognition from Doppler Measurements by Domain-adaption and Few-Shot Learning,0.998015,"In previous works, a mobile application was developed using an unmodified

Back Translation for Speech-to-text Translation Without Transcripts,0.896315,"The success of end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) is often achieved

Exploring the Impact of Training Data Distribution and Subword Tokenization on Gender Bias in Machine Translation,0.127334,"We study the effect of tokenization on gender bias in machine translation, an
aspect that has been largely overlooked in previous works. Specifically, we

profession names (e.g., Spanish ""doctora"" for ""female doctor"") tend to be split
into multiple subword tokens. Our results indicate that the imbalance of gender
forms in the model's training corpus is a major factor contributing to gender
bias and has a greater impact than subword splitting. We show that analyzing
subword splits provides good estimates of gender-form imbalance in the training

Gradient Domain Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis,0.119047,"Diffusion models are getting popular in generative image and video synthesis.
However, due to the diffusion process, they require a large number of steps to

There are two reasons. First, thanks to the Poisson equation, the gradient
domain is mathematically equivalent to the original image domain. Therefore,
each diffusion step in the image domain has a unique corresponding gradient
domain representation. Second, the gradient domain is much sparser than the
image domain. As a result, gradient domain diffusion models converge faster.
Several numerical experiments confirm that the gradient domain diffusion models
are more efficient than the original diffusion models. The proposed method can

Progressively Optimized Local Radiance Fields for Robust View Synthesis,0.852064,"We present an algorithm for reconstructing the radiance field of a

scale to longer trajectories in an unbounded scene. For handling unknown poses,
we jointly estimate the camera poses with radiance field in a progressive
manner. We show that progressive optimization significantly improves the
robustness of the reconstruction. For handling large unbounded scenes, we
dynamically allocate new local radiance fields trained with frames within a
temporal window. This further improves robustness (e.g., performs well even

Collaborative Discrepancy Optimization for Reliable Image Anomaly Localization,0.926908,"Most unsupervised image anomaly localization methods suffer from
overgeneralization because of the high generalization abilities of
convolutional neural networks, leading to unreliable predictions. To mitigate
the overgeneralization, this study proposes to collaboratively optimize normal

namely collaborative discrepancy optimization (CDO). CDO introduces a margin
optimization module and an overlap optimization module to optimize the two key
factors determining the localization performance, i.e., the margin and the
overlap between the discrepancy distributions (DDs) of normal and abnormal
samples. With CDO, a large margin and a small overlap between normal and
abnormal DDs are obtained, and the prediction reliability is boosted.
Experiments on MVTec2D and MVTec3D show that CDO effectively mitigates the

How to Plant Trees in Language Models: Data and Architectural Effects on the Emergence of Syntactic Inductive Biases,0.870064,"Accurate syntactic representations are essential for robust generalization in

inductive bias that favors hierarchical syntactic generalizations. We focus on
architectural features (depth, width, and number of parameters), as well as the
genre and size of the pre-training corpus, diagnosing inductive biases using
two syntactic transformation tasks: question formation and passivization, both

hierarchical generalization: model depth plays greater role than model width.
We also find that pre-training on simpler language, such as child-directed
speech, induces a hierarchical bias using an order-of-magnitude less data than
pre-training on more typical datasets based on web text or Wikipedia; this
suggests that in cognitively plausible language acquisition settings, neural
language models may be more data-efficient than previously thought.",None,-1
Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation,0.721236,"Multilingual Machine Translation promises to improve translation quality
between non-English languages. This is advantageous for several reasons, namely
lower latency (no need to translate twice), and reduced error cascades (e.g.,
avoiding losing gender and formality information when translating through
English). On the downside, adding more languages reduces model capacity per
language, which is usually countered by increasing the overall model size,
making training harder and inference slower. In this work, we introduce
Language-Specific Transformer Layers (LSLs), which allow us to increase model
capacity, while keeping the amount of computation and the number of parameters
used in the forward pass constant. The key idea is to have some layers of the
encoder be source or target language-specific, while keeping the remaining
layers shared. We study the best way to place these layers using a neural
architecture search inspired approach, and achieve an improvement of 1.3 chrF
(1.5 spBLEU) points over not using LSLs on a separate decoder architecture, and
1.9 chrF (2.2 spBLEU) on a shared decoder one.",None,-1
Exploring Large-scale Unlabeled Faces to Enhance Facial Expression Recognition,0.770541,"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an important task in computer vision
and has wide applications in human-computer interaction, intelligent security,
emotion analysis, and other fields. However, the limited size of FER datasets
limits the generalization ability of expression recognition models, resulting
in ineffective model performance. To address this problem, we propose a
semi-supervised learning framework that utilizes unlabeled face data to train
expression recognition models effectively. Our method uses a dynamic threshold
module (\textbf{DTM}) that can adaptively adjust the confidence threshold to
fully utilize the face recognition (FR) data to generate pseudo-labels, thus
improving the model's ability to model facial expressions. In the ABAW5 EXPR

Is More Always Better? The Effects of Personal Characteristics and Level of Detail on the Perception of Explanations in a Recommender System,0.879326,"Despite the acknowledgment that the perception of explanations may vary
considerably between end-users, explainable recommender systems (RS) have
traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all model, whereby the same explanation
level of detail is provided to each user, without taking into consideration
individual user's context, i.e., goals and personal characteristics. To fill
this research gap, we aim in this paper at a shift from a one-size-fits-all to
a personalized approach to explainable recommendation by giving users agency in
deciding which explanation they would like to see. We developed a transparent
Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA) that provides on-demand
personalized explanations of the recommendations, with three levels of detail
(basic, intermediate, advanced) to meet the demands of different types of
end-users. We conducted a within-subject study (N=31) to investigate the
relationship between user's personal characteristics and the explanation level
of detail, and the effects of these two variables on the perception of the
explainable RS with regard to different explanation goals. Our results show
that the perception of explainable RS with different levels of detail is
affected to different degrees by the explanation goal and user type.
Consequently, we suggested some theoretical and design guidelines to support
the systematic design of explanatory interfaces in RS tailored to the user's
context.",None,-1
GeoDE: a Geographically Diverse Evaluation Dataset for Object Recognition,0.572134,"Current dataset collection methods typically scrape large amounts of data

"Dialogue Games for Benchmarking Language Understanding: Motivation, Taxonomy, Strategy",0.135951,"How does one measure ""ability to understand language""? If it is a person's
ability that is being measured, this is a question that almost never poses
itself in an unqualified manner: Whatever formal test is applied, it takes
place on the background of the person's language use in daily social practice,
and what is measured is a specialised variety of language understanding (e.g.,
of a second language; or of written, technical language). Computer programs do
not have this background. What does that mean for the applicability of formal
tests of language understanding? I argue that such tests need to be
complemented with tests of language use embedded in a practice, to arrive at a
more comprehensive evaluation of ""artificial language understanding"". To do
such tests systematically, I propose to use ""Dialogue Games"" -- constructed
activities that provide a situational embedding for language use. I describe a
taxonomy of Dialogue Game types, linked to a model of underlying capabilites
that are tested, and thereby giving an argument for the \emph{construct
validity} of the test. I close with showing how the internal structure of the
taxonomy suggests an ordering from more specialised to more general situational
language understanding, which potentially can provide some strategic guidance
for development in this field.",None,-1
Beyond AUROC & co. for evaluating out-of-distribution detection performance,0.496121,"While there has been a growing research interest in developing

Is In-hospital Meta-information Useful for Abstractive Discharge Summary Generation?,0.281964,"During the patient's hospitalization, the physician must record daily
observations of the patient and summarize them into a brief document called

medical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of

Task-Driven Graph Attention for Hierarchical Relational Object Navigation,0.689056,"Embodied AI agents in large scenes often need to navigate to find objects. In
this work, we study a naturally emerging variant of the object navigation task,
hierarchical relational object navigation (HRON), where the goal is to find
objects specified by logical predicates organized in a hierarchical structure -
objects related to furniture and then to rooms - such as finding an apple on
top of a table in the kitchen. Solving such a task requires an efficient
representation to reason about object relations and correlate the relations in
the environment and in the task goal. HRON in large scenes (e.g. homes) is
particularly challenging due to its partial observability and long horizon,
which invites solutions that can compactly store the past information while
effectively exploring the scene. We demonstrate experimentally that scene
graphs are the best-suited representation compared to conventional
representations such as images or 2D maps. We propose a solution that uses

Diacritic Recognition Performance in Arabic ASR,0.457022,"We present an analysis of diacritic recognition performance in Arabic
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. As most existing Arabic speech
corpora do not contain all diacritical marks, which represent short vowels and
other phonetic information in Arabic script, current state-of-the-art ASR
models do not produce full diacritization in their output. Automatic text-based
diacritization has previously been employed both as a pre-processing step to
train diacritized ASR, or as a post-processing step to diacritize the resulting
ASR hypotheses. It is generally believed that input diacritization degrades ASR
performance, but no systematic evaluation of ASR diacritization performance,
independent of ASR performance, has been conducted to date. In this paper, we
attempt to experimentally clarify whether input diacritiztation indeed degrades
ASR quality, and to compare the diacritic recognition performance against
text-based diacritization as a post-processing step. We start with pre-trained
Arabic ASR models and fine-tune them on transcribed speech data with different
diacritization conditions: manual, automatic, and no diacritization. We isolate
diacritic recognition performance from the overall ASR performance using
coverage and precision metrics. We find that ASR diacritization significantly

In contrast to traditional parameter sharing approaches, which fix or learn a
deterministic sharing pattern during training and apply the same pattern to all
examples during inference, we propose to dynamically decide which parts of the
network to activate based on both the task and the input instance. Our approach
learns a hierarchical gating policy consisting of a task-specific policy for

Mark My Words: Dangers of Watermarked Images in ImageNet,0.0686769,"The utilization of pre-trained networks, especially those trained on

such behavior and to determine which classes are most affected. Additionally,
we examine the impact of watermarks on the extracted features. Contrary to the
popular belief that the Chinese logographic watermarks impact the ""carton""

Egocentric Audio-Visual Object Localization,0.878794,"Humans naturally perceive surrounding scenes by unifying sound and sight in a

first-person recordings, even within a short duration; 2) The out-of-view sound
components can be created while wearers shift their attention. To address the
first problem, we propose a geometry-aware temporal aggregation module to
handle the egomotion explicitly. The effect of egomotion is mitigated by
estimating the temporal geometry transformation and exploiting it to update
visual representations. Moreover, we propose a cascaded feature enhancement
module to tackle the second issue. It improves cross-modal localization
robustness by disentangling visually-indicated audio representation. During

Beyond Shared Vocabulary: Increasing Representational Word Similarities across Languages for Multilingual Machine Translation,0.388172,"Using a vocabulary that is shared across languages is common practice in

transfer pathways via word equivalence classes and rely on graph networks to
fuse word embeddings across languages. Our experiments demonstrate the
advantages of our approach: 1) embeddings of words with similar meanings are
better aligned across languages, 2) our method achieves consistent BLEU
improvements of up to 2.3 points for high- and low-resource MNMT, and 3) less

Mirror-NeRF: Learning Neural Radiance Fields for Mirrors with Whitted-Style Ray Tracing,0.379815,"Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has exhibited significant success in

Two-Stage Learning For the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem,0.432553,"The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is an important combinatorial
optimization problem that arises in manufacturing and service settings. FJSP is
composed of two subproblems, an assignment problem that assigns tasks to

composition is an ongoing challenge even under simplified, deterministic

On Formal Feature Attribution and Its Approximation,0.644615,"Recent years have witnessed the widespread use of artificial intelligence
(AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) models. Despite their tremendous
success, a number of vital problems like ML model brittleness, their fairness,
and the lack of interpretability warrant the need for the active developments
in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and formal ML model verification.
The two major lines of work in XAI include feature selection methods, e.g.
Anchors, and feature attribution techniques, e.g. LIME and SHAP. Despite their
promise, most of the existing feature selection and attribution approaches are
susceptible to a range of critical issues, including explanation unsoundness
and out-of-distribution sampling. A recent formal approach to XAI (FXAI)
although serving as an alternative to the above and free of these issues
suffers from a few other limitations. For instance and besides the scalability
limitation, the formal approach is unable to tackle the feature attribution
problem. Additionally, a formal explanation despite being formally sound is
typically quite large, which hampers its applicability in practical settings.
Motivated by the above, this paper proposes a way to apply the apparatus of
formal XAI to the case of feature attribution based on formal explanation
enumeration. Formal feature attribution (FFA) is argued to be advantageous over
the existing methods, both formal and non-formal. Given the practical
complexity of the problem, the paper then proposes an efficient technique for

Generative Novel View Synthesis with 3D-Aware Diffusion Models,0.996175,"We present a diffusion-based model for 3D-aware generative novel view
synthesis from as few as a single input image. Our model samples from the
distribution of possible renderings consistent with the input and, even in the
presence of ambiguity, is capable of rendering diverse and plausible novel
views. To achieve this, our method makes use of existing 2D diffusion backbones
but, crucially, incorporates geometry priors in the form of a 3D feature
volume. This latent feature field captures the distribution over possible scene
representations and improves our method's ability to generate view-consistent
novel renderings. In addition to generating novel views, our method has the

AugDiff: Diffusion based Feature Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning in Whole Slide Image,0.75864,"Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a powerful strategy for weakly supervised
learning, is able to perform various prediction tasks on gigapixel Whole Slide
Images (WSIs). However, the tens of thousands of patches in WSIs usually incur
a vast computational burden for image augmentation, limiting the MIL model's
improvement in performance. Currently, the feature augmentation-based MIL
framework is a promising solution, while existing methods such as Mixup often
produce unrealistic features. To explore a more efficient and practical
augmentation method, we introduce the Diffusion Model (DM) into MIL for the
first time and propose a feature augmentation framework called AugDiff.
Specifically, we employ the generation diversity of DM to improve the quality
of feature augmentation and the step-by-step generation property to control the
retention of semantic information. We conduct extensive experiments over three
distinct cancer datasets, two different feature extractors, and three prevalent
MIL algorithms to evaluate the performance of AugDiff. Ablation study and
visualization further verify the effectiveness. Moreover, we highlight
AugDiff's higher-quality augmented feature over image augmentation and its
superiority over self-supervised learning. The generalization over external
datasets indicates its broader applications.",None,-1

T3L: Translate-and-Test Transfer Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification,0.628843,"Cross-lingual text classification leverages text classifiers trained in a
high-resource language to perform text classification in other languages with

cross-lingual text classifiers are typically built on large-scale, multilingual
language models (LMs) pretrained on a variety of languages of interest.
However, the performance of these models vary significantly across languages
and classification tasks, suggesting that the superposition of the language
modelling and classification tasks is not always effective. For this reason, in
this paper we propose revisiting the classic ""translate-and-test"" pipeline to
neatly separate the translation and classification stages. The proposed
approach couples 1) a neural machine translator translating from the targeted
language to a high-resource language, with 2) a text classifier trained in the
high-resource language, but the neural machine translator generates ""soft""
translations to permit end-to-end backpropagation during fine-tuning of the

Weight-based Mask for Domain Adaptation,0.331459,"In computer vision, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an approach to
transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a fully-unlabeled

trained using only source samples. The second is that previous approaches align
image-level features regardless of foreground and background, although the
classifier requires foreground features. To solve these problems, we introduce
Weight-based Mask Network (WEMNet) composed of Domain Ignore Module (DIM) and
Semantic Enhancement Module (SEM). DIM obtains domain-agnostic feature
representations via the weight of the domain discriminator and predicts

Action-Quantized Offline Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Skill Learning,0.660441,"The offline reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm provides a general recipe to

necessitates various approximations for applying these techniques. Many of
these challenges are greatly alleviated in discrete action settings, where
offline RL constraints and regularizers can often be computed more precisely or
even exactly. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme for action
quantization. We use a VQ-VAE to learn state-conditioned action quantization,
avoiding the exponential blowup that comes with na\""ive discretization of the

A novel efficient Multi-view traffic-related object detection framework,0.684739,"With the rapid development of intelligent transportation system applications,
a tremendous amount of multi-view video data has emerged to enhance vehicle
perception. However, performing video analytics efficiently by exploiting the
spatial-temporal redundancy from video data remains challenging. Accordingly,
we propose a novel traffic-related framework named CEVAS to achieve efficient
object detection using multi-view video data. Briefly, a fine-grained input
filtering policy is introduced to produce a reasonable region of interest from
the captured images. Also, we design a sharing object manager to manage the
information of objects with spatial redundancy and share their results with
other vehicles. We further derive a content-aware model selection policy to
select detection methods adaptively. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly reduces response latency while achieving the same

BiFormer: Learning Bilateral Motion Estimation via Bilateral Transformer for 4K Video Frame Interpolation,0.591861,"A novel 4K video frame interpolator based on bilateral transformer (BiFormer)

motion estimator. Second, we refine the global motion fields efficiently using
blockwise bilateral cost volumes (BBCVs). Third, we warp the input frames using
the refined motion fields and blend them to synthesize an intermediate frame.

MAPS: A Noise-Robust Progressive Learning Approach for Source-Free Domain Adaptive Keypoint Detection,0.0939712,"Existing cross-domain keypoint detection methods always require accessing the
source data during adaptation, which may violate the data privacy law and pose
serious security concerns. Instead, this paper considers a realistic problem
setting called source-free domain adaptive keypoint detection, where only the
well-trained source model is provided to the target domain. For the challenging
problem, we first construct a teacher-student learning baseline by stabilizing
the predictions under data augmentation and network ensembles. Built on this,
we further propose a unified approach, Mixup Augmentation and Progressive
Selection (MAPS), to fully exploit the noisy pseudo labels of unlabeled target
data during training. On the one hand, MAPS regularizes the model to favor
simple linear behavior in-between the target samples via self-mixup
augmentation, preventing the model from over-fitting to noisy predictions. On
the other hand, MAPS employs the self-paced learning paradigm and progressively
selects pseudo-labeled samples from `easy' to `hard' into the training process
to reduce noise accumulation. Results on four keypoint detection datasets show
that MAPS outperforms the baseline and achieves comparable or even better
results in comparison to previous non-source-free counterparts.",None,-1
OMNI: Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness,0.426649,"Open-ended algorithms aim to learn new, interesting behaviors forever. That
requires a vast environment search space, but there are thus infinitely many
possible tasks. Even after filtering for tasks the current agent can learn
(i.e., learning progress), countless learnable yet uninteresting tasks remain
(e.g., minor variations of previously learned tasks). An Achilles Heel of
open-endedness research is the inability to quantify (and thus prioritize)
tasks that are not just learnable, but also $\textit{interesting}$ (e.g.,
worthwhile and novel). We propose solving this problem by
$\textit{Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness}$
(OMNI). The insight is that we can utilize foundation models (FMs) as a model
of interestingness (MoI), because they $\textit{already}$ internalize human
concepts of interestingness from training on vast amounts of human-generated
data, where humans naturally write about what they find interesting or boring.
We show that FM-based MoIs improve open-ended learning by focusing on tasks
that are both learnable $\textit{and interesting}$, outperforming baselines
based on uniform task sampling or learning progress alone. This approach has
the potential to dramatically advance the ability to intelligently select which
tasks to focus on next (i.e., auto-curricula), and could be seen as AI

Multi-Label Self-Supervised Learning with Scene Images,0.395866,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods targeting scene images have seen a

input image by comparing its embeddings with those in two dictionaries, and the
network is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss. The proposed method
is named Multi-Label Self-supervised learning (MLS). Visualizations
qualitatively show that clearly the pseudo-labels by MLS can automatically find
semantically similar pseudo-positive pairs across different images to
facilitate contrastive learning. MLS learns high quality representations on

Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts,0.474456,"The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides

Causal Models with Constraints,0.156027,"Causal models have proven extremely useful in offering formal representations

standard causal models to allow for constraints on settings of variables.

A Game of Bundle Adjustment -- Learning Efficient Convergence,0.294678,"Bundle adjustment is the common way to solve localization and mapping. It is

"An Ensemble Approach to Question Classification: Integrating Electra Transformer, GloVe, and LSTM",0.184367,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a crucial technology for
understanding and generating human language, playing an essential role in tasks
such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more pertinently, question
classification. As a subfield within NLP, question classification focuses on
determining the type of information being sought, a fundamental step for
downstream applications like question answering systems. This study presents an
innovative ensemble approach for question classification, combining the
strengths of Electra, GloVe, and LSTM models. Rigorously tested on the
well-regarded TREC dataset, the model demonstrates how the integration of these
disparate technologies can lead to superior results. Electra brings in its
transformer-based capabilities for complex language understanding, GloVe offers
global vector representations for capturing word-level semantics, and LSTM
contributes its sequence learning abilities to model long-term dependencies. By
fusing these elements strategically, our ensemble model delivers a robust and

Scalable 3D Captioning with Pretrained Models,0.902648,"We introduce Cap3D, an automatic approach for generating descriptive text for
3D objects. This approach utilizes pretrained models from image captioning,

Dual-Gated Fusion with Prefix-Tuning for Multi-Modal Relation Extraction,0.830708,"Multi-Modal Relation Extraction (MMRE) aims at identifying the relation

paper, we propose a novel MMRE framework to better capture the deeper
correlations of text, entity pair, and image/objects, so as to mine more
helpful information for the task, termed as DGF-PT. We first propose a
prompt-based autoregressive encoder, which builds the associations of
intra-modal and inter-modal features related to the task, respectively by
entity-oriented and object-oriented prefixes. To better integrate helpful
visual information, we design a dual-gated fusion module to distinguish the
importance of image/objects and further enrich text representations. In

Enhancing Neural Theorem Proving through Data Augmentation and Dynamic Sampling Method,0.541608,"Theorem proving is a fundamental task in mathematics. With the advent of
large language models (LLMs) and interactive theorem provers (ITPs) like Lean,
there has been growing interest in integrating LLMs and ITPs to automate
theorem proving. In this approach, the LLM generates proof steps (tactics), and
the ITP checks the applicability of the tactics at the current goal. The two
systems work together to complete the proof. In this paper, we introduce
DS-Prover, a novel dynamic sampling method for theorem proving. This method
dynamically determines the number of tactics to apply to expand the current
goal, taking into account the remaining time compared to the total allocated
time for proving a theorem. This makes the proof search process more efficient
by adjusting the balance between exploration and exploitation as time passes.
We also augment the training dataset by decomposing simplification and rewrite
tactics with multiple premises into tactics with single premises. This gives
the model more examples to learn from and helps it to predict the tactics with
premises more accurately. We perform our experiments using the Mathlib dataset
of the Lean theorem prover and report the performance on two standard datasets,
MiniF2F and ProofNet. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on both

they guarantee $\tilde \Theta(T^{2/3})$ regret. However, in practice
environments are often changing {\bf smoothly}, so such algorithms may incur
higher-than-necessary regret in these settings and do not leverage information

Estimating temperatures with low-cost infrared cameras using deep neural networks,0.141031,"Low-cost thermal cameras are inaccurate (usually $\pm 3^\circ C$) and have

Positive Label Is All You Need for Multi-Label Classification,0.416435,"Multi-label classification (MLC) faces challenges from label noise in

label noise in MLC by introducing a positive and unlabeled multi-label

negative labels, focusing on the abundance of negative labels and the origin of
most noisy labels. PU-MLC employs positive-unlabeled learning, training the

Empirical Analysis of the Strengths and Weaknesses of PEFT Techniques for LLMs,0.45925,"As foundation models continue to exponentially scale in size, efficient
methods of adaptation become increasingly critical. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), a recent class of techniques that require only modifying a
small percentage of the model parameters, is currently the most popular method
for adapting large language models (LLMs). Several PEFT techniques have
recently been proposed with varying tradeoffs. We provide a comprehensive and
uniform benchmark of various PEFT techniques across a representative LLM, the
FLAN-T5 model, and evaluate model performance across different data scales of
classification and generation datasets. Based on this, we provide a framework
for choosing the optimal fine-tuning techniques given the task type and data
availability. Contrary to popular belief, we also empirically prove that PEFT
techniques converge slower than full tuning in low data scenarios, and posit
the amount of data required for PEFT methods to both perform well and converge
efficiently. Lastly, we further optimize these PEFT techniques by selectively
choosing which parts of the model to train, and find that these techniques can
be applied with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining and even
improving performance.",None,-1

A Safe Preference Learning Approach for Personalization with Applications to Autonomous Vehicles,0.11904,"This work introduces a preference learning method that ensures adherence to
given specifications, with an application to autonomous vehicles. Our approach
incorporates the priority ordering of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas

Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (PWSTL), we formulate the problem of
safety-guaranteed preference learning based on pairwise comparisons and propose
an approach to solve this learning problem. Our approach finds a feasible
valuation for the weights of the given PWSTL formula such that, with these
weights, preferred signals have weighted quantitative satisfaction measures
greater than their non-preferred counterparts. The feasible valuation of
weights given by our approach leads to a weighted STL formula that can be used
in correct-and-custom-by-construction controller synthesis. We demonstrate the
performance of our method with a pilot human subject study in two different
simulated driving scenarios involving a stop sign and a pedestrian crossing.

Homophone Disambiguation Reveals Patterns of Context Mixing in Speech Transformers,0.522978,"Transformers have become a key architecture in speech processing, but our
understanding of how they build up representations of acoustic and linguistic

is ideal for such a case study: homophony in French (e.g. livre vs livres),
where a speech recognition model has to attend to syntactic cues such as
determiners and pronouns in order to disambiguate spoken words with identical
pronunciations and transcribe them while respecting grammatical agreement. We
perform a series of controlled experiments and probing analyses on
Transformer-based speech models. Our findings reveal that representations in
encoder-only models effectively incorporate these cues to identify the correct
transcription, whereas encoders in encoder-decoder models mainly relegate the

Mutually Guided Few-shot Learning for Relational Triple Extraction,0.373273,"Knowledge graphs (KGs), containing many entity-relation-entity triples,

relation proto-decoder to classify the relations firstly and a relation-guided
entity proto-decoder to extract entities based on the classified relations. To

Mask Detection and Classification in Thermal Face Images,0.581183,"Face masks are recommended to reduce the transmission of many viruses,

Language Model Tokenizers Introduce Unfairness Between Languages,0.718888,"Recent language models have shown impressive multilingual performance, even
when not explicitly trained for it. Despite this, there are concerns about the
quality of their outputs across different languages. In this paper, we show how
disparity in the treatment of different languages arises at the tokenization

different languages can have drastically different tokenization lengths, with
differences up to 15 times in some cases. These disparities persist even for
tokenizers that are intentionally trained for multilingual support.
Character-level and byte-level models also exhibit over 4 times the difference
in the encoding length for some language pairs. This induces unfair treatment
for some language communities in regard to the cost of accessing commercial
language services, the processing time and latency, as well as the amount of
content that can be provided as context to the models. Therefore, we make the
case that we should train future language models using multilingually fair

MetaTKG: Learning Evolutionary Meta-Knowledge for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning,0.665309,"Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) aims to predict future facts
based on given history. One of the key challenges for prediction is to learn
the evolution of facts. Most existing works focus on exploring evolutionary
information in history to obtain effective temporal embeddings for entities and
relations, but they ignore the variation in evolution patterns of facts, which
makes them struggle to adapt to future data with different evolution patterns.
Moreover, new entities continue to emerge along with the evolution of facts
over time. Since existing models highly rely on historical information to learn
embeddings for entities, they perform poorly on such entities with little
historical information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Temporal
Meta-learning framework for TKG reasoning, MetaTKG for brevity. Specifically,
our method regards TKG prediction as many temporal meta-tasks, and utilizes the
designed Temporal Meta-learner to learn evolutionary meta-knowledge from these
meta-tasks. The proposed method aims to guide the backbones to learn to adapt
quickly to future data and deal with entities with little historical

Which Examples to Annotate for In-Context Learning? Towards Effective and Efficient Selection,0.827955,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning

selection. Diversity-based sampling improves overall effectiveness, while
uncertainty sampling improves budget efficiency and helps the LLM learn new

Exploiting Style Transfer-based Task Augmentation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,0.0437489,"In cross-domain few-shot learning, the core issue is that the model trained

Human Preference Score: Better Aligning Text-to-Image Models with Human Preference,0.521627,"Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of deep generative models, with
text-to-image models gaining significant attention from the public. However,

Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable Filters,0.213176,"Incorporating either rotation equivariance or scale equivariance into CNNs

resolutions, resulting in cells appearing in different scales. When
conventional CNNs are applied to histopathology image analysis, the
generalization performance of models is limited because 1) a part of the
parameters of filters are trained to fit rotation transformation, thus
decreasing the capability of learning other discriminative features; 2)
fixed-size filters trained on images at a given scale fail to generalize to
those at different scales. To deal with these issues, we propose the

A Generalist Dynamics Model for Control,0.599784,"We investigate the use of transformer sequence models as dynamics models
(TDMs) for control. We find that TDMs exhibit strong generalization
capabilities to unseen environments, both in a few-shot setting, where a
generalist TDM is fine-tuned with small amounts of data from the target
environment, and in a zero-shot setting, where a generalist TDM is applied to
an unseen environment without any further training. Here, we demonstrate that
generalizing system dynamics can work much better than generalizing optimal
behavior directly as a policy. Additional results show that TDMs also perform
well in a single-environment learning setting when compared to a number of
baseline models. These properties make TDMs a promising ingredient for a
foundation model of control.",None,-1
Models of reference production: How do they withstand the test of time?,0.0527607,"In recent years, many NLP studies have focused solely on performance
improvement. In this work, we focus on the linguistic and scientific aspects of

comprehensive set of shared tasks in English that addressed this topic over a
decade ago. We ask what the performance of models would be if we assessed them
(1) on more realistic datasets, and (2) using more advanced methods. We test
the models using different evaluation metrics and feature selection
experiments. We conclude that GREC can no longer be regarded as offering a
reliable assessment of models' ability to mimic human reference production,
because the results are highly impacted by the choice of corpus and evaluation
metrics. Our results also suggest that pre-trained language models are less
dependent on the choice of corpus than classic Machine Learning models, and
therefore make more robust class predictions.",None,-1
Implicit Memory Transformer for Computationally Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation,0.618403,"Simultaneous speech translation is an essential communication task difficult
for humans whereby a translation is generated concurrently with oncoming speech
inputs. For such a streaming task, transformers using block processing to break
an input sequence into segments have achieved state-of-the-art performance at a
reduced cost. Current methods to allow information to propagate across
segments, including left context and memory banks, have faltered as they are
both insufficient representations and unnecessarily expensive to compute. In
this paper, we propose an Implicit Memory Transformer that implicitly retains
memory through a new left context method, removing the need to explicitly
represent memory with memory banks. We generate the left context from the
attention output of the previous segment and include it in the keys and values
of the current segment's attention calculation. Experiments on the MuST-C

speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality

Fast Matrix Multiplication Without Tears: A Constraint Programming Approach,0.178464,"It is known that the multiplication of an $N \times M$ matrix with an $M

chosen and combined such that they satisfy correctness constraints on the
output matrix. Despite its highly combinatorial nature, this problem has not

plan execution. More specifically, given a question about a long document,
PEARL decomposes the question into a sequence of actions (e.g., SUMMARIZE,
FIND_EVENT, FIND_RELATION) and then executes them over the document to obtain
the answer. Each stage of PEARL is implemented via zero-shot or few-shot
prompting of LLMs (in our work, GPT-4) with minimal human input. We evaluate
PEARL on a challenging subset of the QuALITY dataset, which contains questions
that require complex reasoning over long narrative texts. PEARL outperforms
zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting on this dataset, and ablation
experiments show that each stage of PEARL is critical to its performance.
Overall, PEARL is a first step towards leveraging LLMs to reason over long

Improving Prosody for Cross-Speaker Style Transfer by Semi-Supervised Style Extractor and Hierarchical Modeling in Speech Synthesis,0.542959,"Cross-speaker style transfer in speech synthesis aims at transferring a style
from source speaker to synthesized speech of a target speaker's timbre. In most
previous methods, the synthesized fine-grained prosody features often represent
the source speaker's average style, similar to the one-to-many problem(i.e.,
multiple prosody variations correspond to the same text). In response to this
problem, a strength-controlled semi-supervised style extractor is proposed to
disentangle the style from content and timbre, improving the representation and
interpretability of the global style embedding, which can alleviate the
one-to-many mapping and data imbalance problems in prosody prediction. A
hierarchical prosody predictor is proposed to improve prosody modeling. We find
that better style transfer can be achieved by using the source speaker's
prosody features that are easily predicted. Additionally, a
speaker-transfer-wise cycle consistency loss is proposed to assist the model in
learning unseen style-timbre combinations during the training phase.
Experimental results show that the method outperforms the baseline. We provide

Linguistically Informed ChatGPT Prompts to Enhance Japanese-Chinese Machine Translation: A Case Study on Attributive Clauses,0.917285,"In the field of Japanese-Chinese translation linguistics, the issue of
correctly translating attributive clauses has persistently proven to be
challenging. Present-day machine translation tools often fail to accurately
translate attributive clauses from Japanese to Chinese. In light of this, this
paper investigates the linguistic problem underlying such difficulties, namely
how does the semantic role of the modified noun affect the selection of
translation patterns for attributive clauses, from a linguistic perspective. To
ad-dress these difficulties, a pre-edit scheme is proposed, which aims to
enhance the accuracy of translation. Furthermore, we propose a novel two-step
prompt strategy, which combines this pre-edit scheme with ChatGPT, currently
the most widely used large language model. This prompt strategy is capable of
optimizing translation input in zero-shot scenarios and has been demonstrated

Communication Efficient Federated Learning for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation with Adapter,0.180921,"Federated Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (Fed-MNMT) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for institutions with limited language resources. This
approach allows multiple institutions to act as clients and train a unified
model through model synchronization, rather than collecting sensitive data for
centralized training. This significantly reduces the cost of corpus collection
and preserves data privacy. However, as pre-trained language models (PLMs)
continue to increase in size, the communication cost for transmitting
parameters during synchronization has become a training speed bottleneck. In
this paper, we propose a communication-efficient Fed-MNMT framework that
addresses this issue by keeping PLMs frozen and only transferring lightweight
adapter modules between clients. Since different language pairs exhibit
substantial discrepancies in data distributions, adapter parameters of clients
may conflict with each other. To tackle this, we explore various clustering
strategies to group parameters for integration and mitigate the negative
effects of conflicting parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework reduces communication cost by over 98% while achieving similar or
even better performance compared to competitive baselines. Further analysis
reveals that clustering strategies effectively solve the problem of linguistic
discrepancy and pruning adapter modules further improves communication
efficiency.",None,-1
Inductive Relation Prediction from Relational Paths and Context with Hierarchical Transformers,0.547752,"Relation prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) is a key research topic.

method that captures both connections between entities and the intrinsic nature
of entities, by simultaneously aggregating RElational Paths and cOntext with a
unified hieRarchical Transformer framework, namely REPORT. REPORT relies solely
on relation semantics and can naturally generalize to the fully-inductive

A Game-Theoretic Framework for Joint Forecasting and Planning,0.874188,"Planning safe robot motions in the presence of humans requires reliable

When 3D Bounding-Box Meets SAM: Point Cloud Instance Segmentation with Weak-and-Noisy Supervision,0.628217,"Learning from bounding-boxes annotations has shown great potential in
weakly-supervised 3D point cloud instance segmentation. However, we observed
that existing methods would suffer severe performance degradation with

complementary image prompt-induced weakly-supervised point cloud instance
segmentation (CIP-WPIS) method. CIP-WPIS leverages pretrained knowledge
embedded in the 2D foundation model SAM and 3D geometric prior to achieve
accurate point-wise instance labels from the bounding box annotations.
Specifically, CP-WPIS first selects image views in which 3D candidate points of
an instance are fully visible. Then, we generate complementary background and
foreground prompts from projections to obtain SAM 2D instance mask predictions.
According to these, we assign the confidence values to points indicating the
likelihood of points belonging to the instance. Furthermore, we utilize 3D
geometric homogeneity provided by superpoints to decide the final instance
label assignments. In this fashion, we achieve high-quality 3D point-wise

Recovering from Privacy-Preserving Masking with Large Language Models,0.497833,"Model adaptation is crucial to handle the discrepancy between proxy training

use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track
the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been
pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate
whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track
entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While
performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated
on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a
finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking. Taken together, these

STAR Loss: Reducing Semantic Ambiguity in Facial Landmark Detection,0.993273,"Recently, deep learning-based facial landmark detection has achieved
significant improvement. However, the semantic ambiguity problem degrades
detection performance. Specifically, the semantic ambiguity causes inconsistent
annotation and negatively affects the model's convergence, leading to worse
accuracy and instability prediction. To solve this problem, we propose a
Self-adapTive Ambiguity Reduction (STAR) loss by exploiting the properties of
semantic ambiguity. We find that semantic ambiguity results in the anisotropic
predicted distribution, which inspires us to use predicted distribution to
represent semantic ambiguity. Based on this, we design the STAR loss that
measures the anisotropism of the predicted distribution. Compared with the
standard regression loss, STAR loss is encouraged to be small when the
predicted distribution is anisotropic and thus adaptively mitigates the impact
of semantic ambiguity. Moreover, we propose two kinds of eigenvalue restriction
methods that could avoid both distribution's abnormal change and the model's

analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation.
Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network

"Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety",0.151271,"Explainability and Safety engender Trust. These require a model to exhibit
consistency and reliability. To achieve these, it is necessary to use and
analyze data and knowledge with statistical and symbolic AI methods relevant to
the AI application - neither alone will do. Consequently, we argue and seek to
demonstrate that the NeuroSymbolic AI approach is better suited for making AI a
trusted AI system. We present the CREST framework that shows how Consistency,
Reliability, user-level Explainability, and Safety are built on NeuroSymbolic
methods that use data and knowledge to support requirements for critical
applications such as health and well-being. This article focuses on Large
Language Models (LLMs) as the chosen AI system within the CREST framework. LLMs
have garnered substantial attention from researchers due to their versatility
in handling a broad array of natural language processing (NLP) scenarios. For
example, ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM have emerged as highly promising
platforms for providing information in general and health-related queries,
respectively. Nevertheless, these models remain black boxes despite
incorporating human feedback and instruction-guided tuning. For instance,
ChatGPT can generate unsafe responses despite instituting safety guardrails.

Language Models Trained on Media Diets Can Predict Public Opinion,0.880255,"Public opinion reflects and shapes societal behavior, but the traditional
survey-based tools to measure it are limited. We introduce a novel approach to
probe media diet models -- language models adapted to online news, TV
broadcast, or radio show content -- that can emulate the opinions of
subpopulations that have consumed a set of media. To validate this method, we
use as ground truth the opinions expressed in U.S. nationally representative
surveys on COVID-19 and consumer confidence. Our studies indicate that this
approach is (1) predictive of human judgements found in survey response
distributions and robust to phrasing and channels of media exposure, (2) more
accurate at modeling people who follow media more closely, and (3) aligned with
literature on which types of opinions are affected by media consumption.
Probing language models provides a powerful new method for investigating media

public opinion, and suggests a need for further study of the surprising
fidelity with which neural language models can predict human responses.",None,-1
Dynamic Large Language Models on Blockchains,0.131313,"Training and deploying the large language models requires a large mount of
computational resource because the language models contain billions of

decentralized, and transparent system that allows for the creation of a
tamper-proof ledger for transactions without the need for intermediaries. The

Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Latent Directions in Diffusion Models,0.206324,"Despite the success of diffusion models (DMs), we still lack a thorough
understanding of their latent space. While image editing with GANs builds upon
latent space, DMs rely on editing the conditions such as text prompts. We
present an unsupervised method to discover interpretable editing directions for
the latent variables $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathcal{X}$ of DMs. Our method adopts
Riemannian geometry between $\mathcal{X}$ and the intermediate feature maps
$\mathcal{H}$ of the U-Nets to provide a deep understanding over the
geometrical structure of $\mathcal{X}$. The discovered semantic latent
directions mostly yield disentangled attribute changes, and they are globally
consistent across different samples. Furthermore, editing in earlier timesteps
edits coarse attributes, while ones in later timesteps focus on high-frequency
details. We define the curvedness of a line segment between samples to show

Large Language Models as Source Planner for Personalized Knowledge-grounded Dialogue,0.699011,"Open-domain dialogue system usually requires different sources of knowledge

Multi-Temporal Lip-Audio Memory for Visual Speech Recognition,0.536859,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) is a task to predict a sentence or word from
lip movements. Some works have been recently presented which use audio signals
to supplement visual information. However, existing methods utilize only
limited information such as phoneme-level features and soft labels of Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) networks. In this paper, we present a Multi-Temporal
Lip-Audio Memory (MTLAM) that makes the best use of audio signals to complement
insufficient information of lip movements. The proposed method is mainly
composed of two parts: 1) MTLAM saves multi-temporal audio features produced
from short- and long-term audio signals, and the MTLAM memorizes a
visual-to-audio mapping to load stored multi-temporal audio features from
visual features at the inference phase. 2) We design an audio temporal model to
produce multi-temporal audio features capturing the context of neighboring

Streaming Punctuation: A Novel Punctuation Technique Leveraging Bidirectional Context for Continuous Speech Recognition,0.354588,"While speech recognition Word Error Rate (WER) has reached human parity for
English, continuous speech recognition scenarios such as voice typing and
meeting transcriptions still suffer from segmentation and punctuation problems,
resulting from irregular pausing patterns or slow speakers. Transformer
sequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context,

production systems, however, are constrained by real-time requirements, making
it hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions.
Context within the segments produced by ASR decoders can be helpful but
limiting in overall punctuation performance for a continuous speech session. In
this paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation
of ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on
punctuation and segmentation accuracy across scenarios. The new system tackles

On the Effectiveness of LayerNorm Tuning for Continual Learning in Vision Transformers,0.607661,"State-of-the-art rehearsal-free continual learning methods exploit the
peculiarities of Vision Transformers to learn task-specific prompts,

while maintaining competitive performance. We achieve this by revisiting and
extending a simple transfer learning idea: learning task-specific normalization
layers. Specifically, we tune the scale and bias parameters of LayerNorm for
each continual learning task, selecting them at inference time based on the
similarity between task-specific keys and the output of the pre-trained model.
To make the classifier robust to incorrect selection of parameters during
inference, we introduce a two-stage training procedure, where we first optimize
the task-specific parameters and then train the classifier with the same

Exploring Anisotropy and Outliers in Multilingual Language Models for Cross-Lingual Semantic Sentence Similarity,0.114879,"Previous work has shown that the representations output by contextual

natural tasks for evaluating multilingual representations. Specifically, we
examine sentence representations. Sentence transformers which are fine-tuned on
parallel resources (that are not always available) perform better on this task,
and we show that their representations are more isotropic. However, we aim to
improve multilingual representations in general. We investigate how much of the

Learnability with PAC Semantics for Multi-agent Beliefs,0.0866735,"The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental

learning algorithms when formulated in a logic. Although weaker than classical
entailment, it allows for a powerful model-theoretic framework for answering
queries. In this paper, we provide a new technical foundation to demonstrate
PAC learning with multi-agent epistemic logics. To circumvent the negative
results in the literature on the difficulty of robust learning with the PAC

Investigating Pre-trained Audio Encoders in the Low-Resource Condition,0.0752444,"Pre-trained speech encoders have been central to pushing state-of-the-art

Stochastic Multi-Person 3D Motion Forecasting,0.889615,"This paper aims to deal with the ignored real-world complexities in prior
work on human motion forecasting, emphasizing the social properties of
multi-person motion, the diversity of motion and social interactions, and the

generative modeling framework that separately models independent individual
motion at the local level and social interactions at the global level. Notably,
this dual-level modeling mechanism can be achieved within a shared generative
model, through introducing learnable latent codes that represent intents of
future motion and switching the codes' modes of operation at different levels.
Our framework is general; we instantiate it with different generative models,

AutoLabel: CLIP-based framework for Open-set Video Domain Adaptation,0.451543,"Open-set Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation (OUVDA) deals with the task of
adapting an action recognition model from a labelled source domain to an

Towards Bridging the Gaps between the Right to Explanation and the Right to be Forgotten,0.47037,"The Right to Explanation and the Right to be Forgotten are two important
principles outlined to regulate algorithmic decision making and data usage in
real-world applications. While the right to explanation allows individuals to
request an actionable explanation for an algorithmic decision, the right to be
forgotten grants them the right to ask for their data to be deleted from all
the databases and models of an organization. Intuitively, enforcing the right
to be forgotten may trigger model updates which in turn invalidate previously
provided explanations, thus violating the right to explanation. In this work,
we investigate the technical implications arising due to the interference
between the two aforementioned regulatory principles, and propose the first

Continual Learning with Scaled Gradient Projection,0.428807,"In neural networks, continual learning results in gradient interference among
sequential tasks, leading to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks while

the learning capability of the new tasks resulting in sub-optimal performance.
To improve new learning while minimizing forgetting, in this paper we propose a
Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) method, where we combine the orthogonal
gradient projections with scaled gradient steps along the important gradient
spaces for the past tasks. The degree of gradient scaling along these spaces

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models,0.0393618,"Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding
retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the
retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input
length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and
memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these
complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time,
using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index
based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system
retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly,
retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient
iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language
modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest
neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a
GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size,
however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time
training for language modeling.",None,-1
Rethinking Boundary Detection in Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation,0.6673,"Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in the community of medical
image analysis. In this paper, a novel network architecture, referred to as
Convolution, Transformer, and Operator (CTO), is proposed. CTO employs a
combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT),
and an explicit boundary detection operator to achieve high recognition
accuracy while maintaining an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.
The proposed CTO follows the standard encoder-decoder segmentation paradigm,
where the encoder network incorporates a popular CNN backbone for capturing
local semantic information, and a lightweight ViT assistant for integrating
long-range dependencies. To enhance the learning capacity on boundary, a
boundary-guided decoder network is proposed that uses a boundary mask obtained
from a dedicated boundary detection operator as explicit supervision to guide
the decoding learning process. The performance of the proposed method is
evaluated on six challenging medical image segmentation datasets, demonstrating

"Beyond the Hype: Assessing the Performance, Trustworthiness, and Clinical Suitability of GPT3.5",0.699482,"The use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare is gaining popularity,

assessed. In high-stakes environments like medical settings, trust and safety

radiologist. In addition, we have a radiologist review the GPT3.5 output to
evaluate its decision-making process. Our evaluation dataset consists of 4,700

Our findings suggest that the GPT3.5 performance falls behind BERT and a
radiologist. However, GPT3.5 outperforms BERT in its ability to explain its

PolyFormer: Referring Image Segmentation as Sequential Polygon Generation,0.853552,"In this work, instead of directly predicting the pixel-level segmentation
masks, the problem of referring image segmentation is formulated as sequential
polygon generation, and the predicted polygons can be later converted into
segmentation masks. This is enabled by a new sequence-to-sequence framework,
Polygon Transformer (PolyFormer), which takes a sequence of image patches and
text query tokens as input, and outputs a sequence of polygon vertices
autoregressively. For more accurate geometric localization, we propose a
regression-based decoder, which predicts the precise floating-point coordinates
directly, without any coordinate quantization error. In the experiments,
PolyFormer outperforms the prior art by a clear margin, e.g., 5.40% and 4.52%
absolute improvements on the challenging RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets. It

4D Panoptic Segmentation as Invariant and Equivariant Field Prediction,0.506944,"In this paper, we develop rotation-equivariant neural networks for 4D
panoptic segmentation. 4D panoptic segmentation is a benchmark task for
autonomous driving that requires recognizing semantic classes and object
instances on the road based on LiDAR scans, as well as assigning temporally
consistent IDs to instances across time. We observe that the driving scenario
is symmetric to rotations on the ground plane. Therefore, rotation-equivariance
could provide better generalization and more robust feature learning.
Specifically, we review the object instance clustering strategies and restate
the centerness-based approach and the offset-based approach as the prediction
of invariant scalar fields and equivariant vector fields. Other sub-tasks are
also unified from this perspective, and different invariant and equivariant
layers are designed to facilitate their predictions. Through evaluation on the
standard 4D panoptic segmentation benchmark of SemanticKITTI, we show that our
equivariant models achieve higher accuracy with lower computational costs

A Systems-Theoretical Formalization of Closed Systems,0.31263,"There is a lack of formalism for some key foundational concepts in systems

"Learning with Impartiality to Walk on the Pareto Frontier of Fairness, Privacy, and Utility",0.474602,"Deploying machine learning (ML) models often requires both fairness and
privacy guarantees. Both of these objectives present unique trade-offs with the
utility (e.g., accuracy) of the model. However, the mutual interactions between
fairness, privacy, and utility are less well-understood. As a result, often
only one objective is optimized, while the others are tuned as
hyper-parameters. Because they implicitly prioritize certain objectives, such
designs bias the model in pernicious, undetectable ways. To address this, we
adopt impartiality as a principle: design of ML pipelines should not favor one
objective over another. We propose impartially-specified models, which provide
us with accurate Pareto frontiers that show the inherent trade-offs between the
objectives. Extending two canonical ML frameworks for privacy-preserving
learning, we provide two methods (FairDP-SGD and FairPATE) to train
impartially-specified models and recover the Pareto frontier. Through

"Modeling Recommender Ecosystems: Research Challenges at the Intersection of Mechanism Design, Reinforcement Learning and Generative Models",0.601129,"Modern recommender systems lie at the heart of complex ecosystems that couple
the behavior of users, content providers, advertisers, and other actors.
Despite this, the focus of the majority of recommender research -- and most
practical recommenders of any import -- is on the local, myopic optimization of
the recommendations made to individual users. This comes at a significant cost
to the long-term utility that recommenders could generate for its users. We
argue that explicitly modeling the incentives and behaviors of all actors in
the system -- and the interactions among them induced by the recommender's

requires: optimization over long horizons using techniques such as

generated for different actors using the methods of social choice; reducing
information asymmetry, while accounting for incentives and strategic behavior,
using the tools of mechanism design; better modeling of both user and

Knowledge Enhanced Semantic Communication Receiver,0.796956,"In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning and natural

Train the evidence retriever to obtain interpretable evidence (i.e.,

Predictable MDP Abstraction for Unsupervised Model-Based RL,0.390385,"A key component of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamics
model that predicts the outcomes of actions. Errors in this predictive model
can degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov

instead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on
a transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable,
easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much
as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate,
which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This
transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is
specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based
control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We

Physics-Aware Semi-Supervised Underwater Image Enhancement,0.512716,"Underwater images normally suffer from degradation due to the transmission

Why We Don't Have AGI Yet,0.0662221,"The original vision of AI was re-articulated in 2002 via the term 'Artificial
General Intelligence' or AGI. This vision is to build 'Thinking Machines' -
computer systems that can learn, reason, and solve problems similar to the way
humans do. This is in stark contrast to the 'Narrow AI' approach practiced by
almost everyone in the field over the many decades. While several large-scale
efforts have nominally been working on AGI (most notably DeepMind), the field
of pure focused AGI development has not been well funded or promoted. This is
surprising given the fantastic value that true AGI can bestow on humanity. In
addition to the dearth of effort in this field, there are also several
theoretical and methodical missteps that are hampering progress. We highlight
why purely statistical approaches are unlikely to lead to AGI, and identify
several crucial cognitive abilities required to achieve human-like adaptability
and autonomous learning. We conclude with a survey of socio-technical factors
that have undoubtedly slowed progress towards AGI.",None,-1
Multilingual Event Extraction from Historical Newspaper Adverts,0.371531,"NLP methods can aid historians in analyzing textual materials in greater
volumes than manually feasible. Developing such methods poses substantial
challenges though. First, acquiring large, annotated historical datasets is
difficult, as only domain experts can reliably label them. Second, most
available off-the-shelf NLP models are trained on modern language texts,
rendering them significantly less effective when applied to historical corpora.
This is particularly problematic for less well studied tasks, and for languages
other than English. This paper addresses these challenges while focusing on the
under-explored task of event extraction from a novel domain of historical
texts. We introduce a new multilingual dataset in English, French, and Dutch
composed of newspaper ads from the early modern colonial period reporting on
enslaved people who liberated themselves from enslavement. We find that: 1)
even with scarce annotated data, it is possible to achieve surprisingly good
results by formulating the problem as an extractive QA task and leveraging
existing datasets and models for modern languages; and 2) cross-lingual
low-resource learning for historical languages is highly challenging, and
machine translation of the historical datasets to the considered target
languages is, in practice, often the best-performing solution.",None,-1

RoomDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis with Coherent Geometry and Texture,0.803171,"The techniques for 3D indoor scene capturing are widely used, but the meshes

which leverages powerful natural language to synthesize a new room with a
different style. Unlike existing image synthesis methods, our work addresses
the challenge of synthesizing both geometry and texture aligned to the input
scene structure and prompt simultaneously. The key insight is that a scene
should be treated as a whole, taking into account both scene texture and
geometry. The proposed framework consists of two significant components:
Geometry Guided Diffusion and Mesh Optimization. Geometry Guided Diffusion for
3D Scene guarantees the consistency of the scene style by applying the 2D prior
to the entire scene simultaneously. Mesh Optimization improves the geometry and
texture jointly and eliminates the artifacts in the scanned scene. To validate
the proposed method, real indoor scenes scanned with smartphones are used for

Schema Graph-Guided Prompt for Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking,0.325169,"Tracking dialogue states is an essential topic in task-oriented dialogue
systems, which involve filling in the necessary information in pre-defined

domain-specific prompts by incorporating the dialogue schema. Specifically, we
embed domain-specific schema encoded by a graph neural network into the
pre-trained language model, which allows for relations in the schema to guide
the model for better adaptation to the specific domain. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed graph-based method outperforms other multi-domain

3D-aware blending. For 3D-aware alignment, we first estimate the camera pose of
the reference image with respect to generative NeRFs and then perform 3D local
alignment for each part. To further leverage 3D information of the generative
NeRF, we propose 3D-aware blending that directly blends images on the NeRF's

Data Association Aware POMDP Planning with Hypothesis Pruning Performance Guarantees,0.11938,"Autonomous agents that operate in the real world must often deal with partial
observability, which is commonly modeled as partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). However, traditional POMDP models rely on the
assumption of complete knowledge of the observation source, known as fully
observable data association. To address this limitation, we propose a planning
algorithm that maintains multiple data association hypotheses, represented as a
belief mixture, where each component corresponds to a different data
association hypothesis. However, this method can lead to an exponential growth
in the number of hypotheses, resulting in significant computational overhead.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a pruning-based approach for planning
with ambiguous data associations. Our key contribution is to derive bounds
between the value function based on the complete set of hypotheses and the
value function based on a pruned-subset of the hypotheses, enabling us to
establish a trade-off between computational efficiency and performance. We
demonstrate how these bounds can both be used to certify any pruning heuristic
in retrospect and propose a novel approach to determine which hypotheses to
prune in order to ensure a predefined limit on the loss. We evaluate our
approach in simulated environments and demonstrate its efficacy in handling
multi-modal belief hypotheses with ambiguous data associations.",None,-1
Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings from Scratch,0.436229,"Contrastive learning has been the dominant approach to train state-of-the-art

However, even in the case of unlabeled data, their acquisition presents

we present SynCSE, a contrastive learning framework that trains sentence
embeddings with synthesized data. Specifically, we explore utilizing large
language models to synthesize the required data samples for contrastive
learning, including (1) producing positive and negative annotations given
unlabeled sentences (SynCSE-partial), and (2) generating sentences along with
their corresponding annotations from scratch (SynCSE-scratch). Experimental

Mixture of Soft Prompts for Controllable Data Generation,0.497039,"Large language models (LLMs) effectively generate fluent text when the target
output follows natural language patterns. However, structured prediction tasks
confine the output format to a limited ontology, causing even very large models

limitations. We flip the problem on its head by leveraging the LLM as a tool
for data augmentation rather than direct prediction. Our proposed Mixture of
Soft Prompts (MSP) serves as a parameter-efficient procedure for generating
data in a controlled manner. Denoising mechanisms are further applied to
improve the quality of synthesized data. Automatic metrics show our method is

Temporal Inductive Path Neural Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning,0.577294,"Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of traditional Knowledge Graph
(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural
Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent
perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history
temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from
history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths on a

presented, and meanwhile, an optimal encoding tree is generated. On each
non-root tree node, a new aggregation function and condition structural entropy
are designed to achieve hierarchical state abstraction and compensate for
sampling-induced essential information loss in state abstraction. Empirical
evaluations on a visual gridworld domain and six continuous control benchmarks
demonstrate that, compared with five SOTA state abstraction approaches, SISA

Class-Balancing Diffusion Models,0.185954,"Diffusion-based models have shown the merits of generating high-quality

We conclude with an analysis of the creative possibilities enabled by

Emergent Communication with Attention,0.437692,"To develop computational agents that better communicate using their own
emergent language, we endow the agents with an ability to focus their attention

Speaker and Listener agents in a referential game and show attention leads to
more compositional and interpretable emergent language. We also demonstrate how
attention aids in understanding the learned communication protocol by
investigating the attention weights associated with each message symbol and the
alignment of attention weights between Speaker and Listener agents. Overall,
our results suggest that attention is a promising mechanism for developing more

Dialogizer: Context-aware Conversational-QA Dataset Generation from Textual Sources,0.195585,"To address the data scarcity issue in Conversational question answering
(ConvQA), a dialog inpainting method, which utilizes documents to generate
ConvQA datasets, has been proposed. However, the original dialog inpainting
model is trained solely on the dialog reconstruction task, resulting in the
generation of questions with low contextual relevance due to insufficient
learning of question-answer alignment. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a novel framework called Dialogizer, which has the capability to automatically
generate ConvQA datasets with high contextual relevance from textual sources.
The framework incorporates two training tasks: question-answer matching (QAM)
and topic-aware dialog generation (TDG). Moreover, re-ranking is conducted
during the inference phase based on the contextual relevance of the generated
questions. Using our framework, we produce four ConvQA datasets by utilizing
documents from multiple domains as the primary source. Through automatic
evaluation using diverse metrics, as well as human evaluation, we validate that
our proposed framework exhibits the ability to generate datasets of higher
quality compared to the baseline dialog inpainting model.",None,-1
Compressing Context to Enhance Inference Efficiency of Large Language Models,0.142808,"Large language models (LLMs) achieved remarkable performance across various
tasks. However, they face challenges in managing long documents and extended
conversations, due to significantly increased computational requirements, both

Selective Context that enhances the inference efficiency of LLMs by identifying
and pruning redundancy in the input context to make the input more compact. We
test our approach using common data sources requiring long context processing:
arXiv papers, news articles, and long conversations, on tasks of summarisation,
question answering, and response generation. Experimental results show that
Selective Context significantly reduces memory cost and decreases generation
latency while maintaining comparable performance compared to that achieved when
full context is used. Specifically, we achieve a 50\% reduction in context
cost, resulting in a 36\% reduction in inference memory usage and a 32\%
reduction in inference time, while observing only a minor drop of .023 in

ordinary, ""worldly"" knowledge exhibited by human agents, and explore this in
terms of the degree to which instrumental knowledge can be said to incorporate
the structured world models of cognitive science. We discuss ways LLMs could

SFD2: Semantic-guided Feature Detection and Description,0.90005,"Visual localization is a fundamental task for various applications including
autonomous driving and robotics. Prior methods focus on extracting large
amounts of often redundant locally reliable features, resulting in limited
efficiency and accuracy, especially in large-scale environments under
challenging conditions. Instead, we propose to extract globally reliable
features by implicitly embedding high-level semantics into both the detection

detect keypoints from reliable regions (e.g. building, traffic lane) and
suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on
explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by
reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding
the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our
descriptors are augmented with semantics and have stronger discriminative
ability, providing more inliers at test time. Particularly, experiments on
long-term large-scale visual localization Aachen Day-Night and RobotCar-Seasons

Everyone Deserves A Reward: Learning Customized Human Preferences,0.750768,"Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)

Sci-CoT: Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation in Small Models for Scientific QA,0.292794,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across wide

Kernel Density Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning,0.46325,"Inverse reinforcement learning~(IRL) is a powerful framework to infer an

All Should Be Equal in the Eyes of Language Models: Counterfactually Aware Fair Text Generation,0.0764723,"Fairness in Language Models (LMs) remains a longstanding challenge, given the
inherent biases in training data that can be perpetuated by models and affect
the downstream tasks. Recent methods employ expensive retraining or attempt
debiasing during inference by constraining model outputs to contrast from a
reference set of biased templates or exemplars. Regardless, they dont address
the primary goal of fairness to maintain equitability across different
demographic groups. In this work, we posit that inferencing LMs to generate
unbiased output for one demographic under a context ensues from being aware of
outputs for other demographics under the same context. To this end, we propose
Counterfactually Aware Fair InferencE (CAFIE), a framework that dynamically
compares the model understanding of diverse demographics to generate more
equitable sentences. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using base
LMs of varying sizes and across three diverse datasets and found that CAFIE
outperforms strong baselines. CAFIE produces fairer text and strikes the best
balance between fairness and language modeling capability",None,-1
DFormer: Diffusion-guided Transformer for Universal Image Segmentation,0.318751,"This paper introduces an approach, named DFormer, for universal image
segmentation. The proposed DFormer views universal image segmentation task as a
denoising process using a diffusion model. DFormer first adds various levels of
Gaussian noise to ground-truth masks, and then learns a model to predict
denoising masks from corrupted masks. Specifically, we take deep pixel-level
features along with the noisy masks as inputs to generate mask features and
attention masks, employing diffusion-based decoder to perform mask prediction
gradually. At inference, our DFormer directly predicts the masks and
corresponding categories from a set of randomly-generated masks. Extensive
experiments reveal the merits of our proposed contributions on different image
segmentation tasks: panoptic segmentation, instance segmentation, and semantic
segmentation. Our DFormer outperforms the recent diffusion-based panoptic
segmentation method Pix2Seq-D with a gain of 3.6% on MS COCO val2017 set.

Impact of translation on biomedical information extraction from real-life clinical notes,0.54724,"The objective of our study is to determine whether using English tools to
extract and normalize French medical concepts on translations provides
comparable performance to French models trained on a set of annotated French
clinical notes. We compare two methods: a method involving French language
models and a method involving English language models. For the native French
method, the Named Entity Recognition (NER) and normalization steps are
performed separately. For the translated English method, after the first
translation step, we compare a two-step method and a terminology-oriented
method that performs extraction and normalization at the same time. We used
French, English and bilingual annotated datasets to evaluate all steps (NER,
normalization and translation) of our algorithms. Concerning the results, the
native French method performs better than the translated English one with a
global f1 score of 0.51 [0.47;0.55] against 0.39 [0.34;0.44] and 0.38

"Reason for Future, Act for Now: A Principled Framework for Autonomous LLM Agents with Provable Sample Efficiency",0.919375,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but
translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In
particular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a
minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an
internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework
with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we
call ""reason for future, act for now"" (\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design
a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a
future trajectory over a long horizon (""reason for future""). At each step, the
LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (""act for now""),
stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning
routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.
  The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in
Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt
LLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory
buffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps
that maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning
subroutines are performed in an ""in-context"" manner to emulate the actor-critic
update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of
long-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret. Here,
$T$ denotes the number of online interactions. In particular, the regret bound
highlights an intriguing interplay between the prior knowledge obtained through
pretraining and the uncertainty reduction achieved by reasoning and acting. Our
empirical validation shows that it outperforms various existing frameworks and
achieves nearly perfect scores on a few benchmarks.",None,-1
Efficient Large-scale Scene Representation with a Hybrid of High-resolution Grid and Plane Features,0.521483,"Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods for large-scale scene modeling
require days of training using multiple GPUs, hindering their applications in
scenarios with limited computing resources. Despite fast optimization NeRF
variants have been proposed based on the explicit dense or hash grid features,
their effectivenesses are mainly demonstrated in object-scale scene
representation. In this paper, we point out that the low feature resolution in
explicit representation is the bottleneck for large-scale unbounded scene
representation. To address this problem, we introduce a new and efficient
hybrid feature representation for NeRF that fuses the 3D hash-grids and
high-resolution 2D dense plane features. Compared with the dense-grid
representation, the resolution of a dense 2D plane can be scaled up more
efficiently. Based on this hybrid representation, we propose a fast
optimization NeRF variant, called GP-NeRF, that achieves better rendering
results while maintaining a compact model size. Extensive experiments on
multiple large-scale unbounded scene datasets show that our model can converge
in 1.5 hours using a single GPU while achieving results comparable to or even
better than the existing method that requires about one day's training with 8

Estimation of the qualification and behavior of a contributor and aggregation of his answers in a crowdsourcing context,0.747399,"Crowdsourcing is the outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of contributors on a
dedicated platform. The crowd on these platforms is very diversified and
includes various profiles of contributors which generates data of uneven
quality. However, majority voting, which is the aggregating method commonly
used in platforms, gives equal weight to each contribution. To overcome this
problem, we propose a method, MONITOR, which estimates the contributor's

imperfections thanks to the theory of belief functions. To do so, MONITOR
starts by estimating the profile of the contributor through his qualification

Laplacian ICP for Progressive Registration of 3D Human Head Meshes,0.399427,"We present a progressive 3D registration framework that is a highly-efficient

increasingly flexible deformation model, an increasing number of correspondence
sets, and increasingly sophisticated correspondence estimation. Correspondence
matching is only permitted within predefined vertex subsets derived from
domain-specific feature extractors. Additionally, we present a new benchmark

Rotation-Invariant Completion Network,0.408424,"Real-world point clouds usually suffer from incompleteness and display
different poses. While current point cloud completion methods excel in
reproducing complete point clouds with consistent poses as seen in the training

Network (RICNet), which consists of two parts: a Dual Pipeline Completion
Network (DPCNet) and an enhancing module. Firstly, DPCNet generates a coarse
complete point cloud. The feature extraction module of DPCNet can extract
consistent features, no matter if the input point cloud has undergone rotation
or translation. Subsequently, the enhancing module refines the fine-grained
details of the final generated point cloud. RICNet achieves better rotation
invariance in feature extraction and incorporates structural relationships in
man-made objects. To assess the performance of RICNet and existing methods on

3D Feature Prediction for Masked-AutoEncoder-Based Point Cloud Pretraining,0.871314,"Masked autoencoders (MAE) have recently been introduced to 3D self-supervised
pretraining for point clouds due to their great success in NLP and computer

restore features at the masked pixels, such as colors, the existing 3D MAE
works reconstruct the missing geometry only, i.e, the location of the masked
points. In contrast to previous studies, we advocate that point location
recovery is inessential and restoring intrinsic point features is much
superior. To this end, we propose to ignore point position reconstruction and
recover high-order features at masked points including surface normals and
surface variations, through a novel attention-based decoder which is
independent of the encoder design. We validate the effectiveness of our pretext

Cost-Efficient Prompt Engineering for Unsupervised Entity Resolution,0.819605,"Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of semi-automatically determining when
two entities refer to the same underlying entity, with applications ranging
from healthcare to e-commerce. Traditional ER solutions required considerable
manual expertise, including domain-specific feature engineering, as well as

models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to make ER more seamless and
domain-independent. However, it is also well known that LLMs can pose risks,

Unfortunately, a systematic experimental study on the effects of different
prompting methods for addressing unsupervised ER, using LLMs like ChatGPT, has
been lacking thus far. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting such a

Going faster to see further: GPU-accelerated value iteration and simulation for perishable inventory control using JAX,0.396407,"Value iteration can find the optimal replenishment policy for a perishable
inventory problem, but is computationally demanding due to the large state
spaces that are required to represent the age profile of stock. The parallel
processing capabilities of modern GPUs can reduce the wall time required to run
value iteration by updating many states simultaneously. The adoption of
GPU-accelerated approaches has been limited in operational research relative to
other fields like machine learning, in which new software frameworks have made
GPU programming widely accessible. We used the Python library JAX to implement
value iteration and simulators of the underlying Markov decision processes in a
high-level API, and relied on this library's function transformations and
compiler to efficiently utilize GPU hardware. Our method can extend use of
value iteration to settings that were previously considered infeasible or
impractical. We demonstrate this on example scenarios from three recent studies
which include problems with over 16 million states and additional problem
features, such as substitution between products, that increase computational
complexity. We compare the performance of the optimal replenishment policies to
heuristic policies, fitted using simulation optimization in JAX which allowed
the parallel evaluation of multiple candidate policy parameters on thousands of

"What Should Be Balanced in a ""Balanced"" Face Recognition Dataset?",0.663357,"The issue of demographic disparities in face recognition accuracy has

Rethinking the BERT-like Pretraining for DNA Sequences,0.692554,"With the success of large-scale pretraining in NLP, there is an increasing
trend of applying it to the domain of life sciences. In particular, pretraining
methods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their
potential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing
pretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT
pretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically
tailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of
exploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the
fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping
tokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping
and non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance
improvement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping
tokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a
very low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less
distinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping
tokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of
pre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that
these layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization
can benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate
pretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we
introduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the
task difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask
boundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but

Semi-Supervised SAR ATR Framework with Transductive Auxiliary Segmentation,0.999866,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high performance in
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). However, the
performance of CNNs depends heavily on a large amount of training data. The
insufficiency of labeled training SAR images limits the recognition performance
and even invalidates some ATR methods. Furthermore, under few labeled training
data, many existing CNNs are even ineffective. To address these challenges, we
propose a Semi-supervised SAR ATR Framework with transductive Auxiliary
Segmentation (SFAS). The proposed framework focuses on exploiting the
transductive generalization on available unlabeled samples with an auxiliary
loss serving as a regularizer. Through auxiliary segmentation of unlabeled SAR
samples and information residue loss (IRL) in training, the framework can
employ the proposed training loop process and gradually exploit the information
compilation of recognition and segmentation to construct a helpful inductive
bias and achieve high performance. Experiments conducted on the MSTAR dataset
have shown the effectiveness of our proposed SFAS for few-shot learning. The
recognition performance of 94.18\% can be achieved under 20 training samples in
each class with simultaneous accurate segmentation results. Facing variances of
EOCs, the recognition ratios are higher than 88.00\% when 10 training samples

Deep Image Harmonization with Globally Guided Feature Transformation and Relation Distillation,0.416548,"Given a composite image, image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground

transfer the foreground-background relation from real images to composite

A Formal Perspective on Byte-Pair Encoding,0.739265,"Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular algorithm used for tokenizing data in
NLP, despite being devised initially as a compression method. BPE appears to be
a greedy algorithm at face value, but the underlying optimization problem that
BPE seeks to solve has not yet been laid down. We formalize BPE as a
combinatorial optimization problem. Via submodular functions, we prove that the
iterative greedy version is a
$\frac{1}{{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}}(1-e^{-{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}})$-approximation
of an optimal merge sequence, where ${\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}$ is the
total backward curvature with respect to the optimal merge sequence
$\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star$. Empirically the lower bound of the approximation is
$\approx 0.37$.
  We provide a faster implementation of BPE which improves the runtime
complexity from $\mathcal{O}\left(N M\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}\left(N \log
M\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length and $M$ is the merge count.
Finally, we optimize the brute-force algorithm for optimal BPE using
memoization.",None,-1
AutoHall: Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation for Large Language Models,0.0617634,"While Large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread applications

manual annotation of the hallucinatory generation. To address this issue, this

hallucination datasets based on existing fact-checking datasets called
AutoHall. Furthermore, we propose a zero-resource and black-box hallucination

DiffCap: Exploring Continuous Diffusion on Image Captioning,0.208906,"Current image captioning works usually focus on generating descriptions in an
autoregressive manner. However, there are limited works that focus on
generating descriptions non-autoregressively, which brings more decoding
diversity. Inspired by the success of diffusion models on generating
natural-looking images, we propose a novel method DiffCap to apply continuous
diffusions on image captioning. Unlike image generation where the output is
fixed-size and continuous, image description length varies with discrete
tokens. Our method transforms discrete tokens in a natural way and applies
continuous diffusion on them to successfully fuse extracted image features for
diffusion caption generation. Our experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate that
our method uses a much simpler structure to achieve comparable results to the
previous non-autoregressive works. Apart from quality, an intriguing property
of DiffCap is its high diversity during generation, which is missing from many
autoregressive models. We believe our method on fusing multimodal features in
diffusion language generation will inspire more researches on multimodal
language generation tasks for its simplicity and decoding flexibility.",None,-1
Extrinsically-Focused Evaluation of Omissions in Medical Summarization,0.152583,"The goal of automated summarization techniques (Paice, 1990; Kupiec et al,

rigorous evaluation is required, especially given the potential for LLMs to
omit important information in the resulting summary. We propose MED-OMIT, a new
omission benchmark for medical summarization. Given a doctor-patient
conversation and a generated summary, MED-OMIT categorizes the chat into a set
of facts and identifies which are omitted from the summary. We further propose
to determine fact importance by simulating the impact of each fact on a
downstream clinical task: differential diagnosis (DDx) generation. MED-OMIT
leverages LLM prompt-based approaches which categorize the importance of facts

metrics.",None,-1
Egocentric Hierarchical Visual Semantics,0.0848544,"We are interested in aligning how people think about objects and what
machines perceive, meaning by this the fact that object recognition, as
performed by a machine, should follow a process which resembles that followed
by humans when thinking of an object associated with a certain concept. The
ultimate goal is to build systems which can meaningfully interact with their
users, describing what they perceive in the users' own terms. As from the field
of Lexical Semantics, humans organize the meaning of words in hierarchies where
the meaning of, e.g., a noun, is defined in terms of the meaning of a more
general noun, its genus, and of one or more differentiating properties, its
differentia. The main tenet of this paper is that object recognition should
implement a hierarchical process which follows the hierarchical semantic
structure used to define the meaning of words. We achieve this goal by
implementing an algorithm which, for any object, recursively recognizes its
visual genus and its visual differentia. In other words, the recognition of an
object is decomposed in a sequence of steps where the locally relevant visual
features are recognized. This paper presents the algorithm and a first
evaluation.",None,-1
Temporal Segment Transformer for Action Segmentation,0.0578989,"Recognizing human actions from untrimmed videos is an important task in
activity understanding, and poses unique challenges in modeling long-range
temporal relations. Recent works adopt a predict-and-refine strategy which
converts an initial prediction to action segments for global context modeling.
However, the generated segment representations are often noisy and exhibit
inaccurate segment boundaries, over-segmentation and other problems. To deal
with these issues, we propose an attention based approach which we call
\textit{temporal segment transformer}, for joint segment relation modeling and
denoising. The main idea is to denoise segment representations using attention
between segment and frame representations, and also use inter-segment attention
to capture temporal correlations between segments. The refined segment
representations are used to predict action labels and adjust segment
boundaries, and a final action segmentation is produced based on voting from
segment masks. We show that this novel architecture achieves state-of-the-art

Synthetic Query Generation for Privacy-Preserving Deep Retrieval Systems using Differentially Private Language Models,0.625143,"We address the challenge of ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees in

prioritizes ensuring query privacy prior to training a deep retrieval system.
Our method employs DP language models (LMs) to generate private synthetic
queries representative of the original data. These synthetic queries can be

"General Policies, Subgoal Structure, and Planning Width",0.0761464,"It has been observed that many classical planning domains with atomic goals
can be solved by means of a simple polynomial exploration procedure, called IW,
that runs in time exponential in the problem width, which in these cases is
bounded and small. Yet, while the notion of width has become part of
state-of-the-art planning algorithms such as BFWS, there is no good explanation
for why so many benchmark domains have bounded width when atomic goals are
considered. In this work, we address this question by relating bounded width
with the existence of general optimal policies that in each planning instance
are represented by tuples of atoms of bounded size. We also define the notions
of (explicit) serializations and serialized width that have a broader scope as
many domains have a bounded serialized width but no bounded width. Such
problems are solved non-optimally in polynomial time by a suitable variant of
the Serialized IW algorithm. Finally, the language of general policies and the
semantics of serializations are combined to yield a simple, meaningful, and
expressive language for specifying serializations in compact form in the form

methods largely elevate the retouching efficiency and provide promising
retouched results. However, existing portrait retouching methods focus on
automatic retouching, which treats all human-regions equally and ignores users'
preferences for specific individuals, thus suffering from limited flexibility
in interactive scenarios. In this work, we emphasize the importance of users'
intents and explore the interactive portrait retouching task. Specifically, we
propose a region-aware retouching framework with two branches: an automatic
branch and an interactive branch. The automatic branch involves an
encoding-decoding process, which searches region candidates and performs
automatic region-aware retouching without user guidance. The interactive branch
encodes sparse user guidance into a priority condition vector and modulates
latent features with a region selection module to further emphasize the
user-specified regions. Experimental results show that our interactive branch
effectively captures users' intents and generalizes well to unseen scenes with
sparse user guidance, while our automatic branch also outperforms the
state-of-the-art retouching methods due to improved region-awareness.",None,-1
Bio-Inspired Night Image Enhancement Based on Contrast Enhancement and Denoising,0.0132777,"Due to the low accuracy of object detection and recognition in many
intelligent surveillance systems at nighttime, the quality of night images is
crucial. Compared with the corresponding daytime image, nighttime image is
characterized as low brightness, low contrast and high noise. In this paper, a
bio-inspired image enhancement algorithm is proposed to convert a low
illuminance image to a brighter and clear one. Different from existing
bio-inspired algorithm, the proposed method doesn't use any training sequences,
we depend on a novel chain of contrast enhancement and denoising algorithms
without using any forms of recursive functions. Our method can largely improve
the brightness and contrast of night images, besides, suppress noise. Then we
implement on real experiment, and simulation experiment to test our algorithms.

Large Language Models can Learn Rules,0.981307,"When prompted with a few examples and intermediate steps, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various reasoning
tasks. However, prompting methods that rely on implicit knowledge in an LLM
often generate incorrect answers when the implicit knowledge is wrong or
inconsistent with the task. To tackle this problem, we present
Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that learns a rule library for
reasoning with LLMs. HtT contains two stages, an induction stage and a
deduction stage. In the induction stage, an LLM is first asked to generate and
verify rules over a set of training examples. Rules that appear and lead to
correct answers sufficiently often are collected to form a rule library. In the
deduction stage, the LLM is then prompted to employ the learned rule library to
perform reasoning to answer test questions. Experiments on relational
reasoning, numerical reasoning and concept learning problems show that HtT
improves existing prompting methods, with an absolute gain of 10-30% in
accuracy. The learned rules are also transferable to different models and to
different forms of the same problem.",None,-1

Large-Scale Knowledge Synthesis and Complex Information Retrieval from Biomedical Documents,0.298113,"Recent advances in the healthcare industry have led to an abundance of

Harnessing Deep Learning and HPC Kernels via High-Level Loop and Tensor Abstractions on CPU Architectures,0.0222361,"During the past decade, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, programming systems
and hardware have converged with the High Performance Computing (HPC)
counterparts. Nevertheless, the programming methodology of DL and HPC systems

optimizations efforts, while they underperform in the remaining use-cases,
yielding non-portable codes with performance glass-jaws. This work introduces a
framework to develop efficient, portable DL and HPC kernels for modern CPU

the computational core using Tensor Processing Primitives (TPPs): a compact,
versatile set of 2D-tensor operators, 2) Expressing the logical loops around
TPPs in a high-level, declarative fashion whereas the exact instantiation

Arabic Dialect Identification under Scrutiny: Limitations of Single-label Classification,0.972463,"Automatic Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) of text has gained great
popularity since it was introduced in the early 2010s. Multiple datasets were

Arabic. We argue that the currently adopted framing of the ADI task as a
single-label classification problem is one of the main reasons for that. We
highlight the limitation of the incompleteness of the Dialect labels and
demonstrate how it impacts the evaluation of ADI systems. A manual error
analysis for the predictions of an ADI, performed by 7 native speakers of
different Arabic dialects, revealed that $\approx$ 66% of the validated errors

On the Opportunities and Challenges of Foundation Models for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence,0.999999,"Large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), are trained
in a task-agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide
range of downstream tasks by fine-tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning.
Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet seen an
attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence
(GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing
multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of
many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple
geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban
Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial
tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location
description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series
forecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific
fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However,
on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data
modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view
image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image
scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform
task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the
major challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodality
nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each
geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal foundation
model which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial
alignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks and
challenges to develop such a model for GeoAI.",None,-1

Universal Agent Mixtures and the Geometry of Intelligence,0.133282,"Inspired by recent progress in multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL), in

universal agents by introducing a weighted mixture operation. Given a weighted
set of agents, their weighted mixture is a new agent whose expected total
reward in any environment is the corresponding weighted average of the original
agents' expected total rewards in that environment. Thus, if RL agent
intelligence is quantified in terms of performance across environments, the
weighted mixture's intelligence is the weighted average of the original agents'
intelligences. This operation enables various interesting new theorems that
shed light on the geometry of RL agent intelligence, namely: results about
symmetries, convex agent-sets, and local extrema. We also show that any RL
agent intelligence measure based on average performance across environments,
subject to certain weak technical conditions, is identical (up to a constant
factor) to performance within a single environment dependent on said
intelligence measure.",None,-1

Silver Syntax Pre-training for Cross-Domain Relation Extraction,0.231544,"Relation Extraction (RE) remains a challenging task, especially when
considering realistic out-of-domain evaluations. One of the main reasons for

high-quality (manually annotated) data is extremely expensive and cannot
realistically be repeated for each new domain. An intermediate training step on
data from related tasks has shown to be beneficial across many NLP
tasks.However, this setup still requires supplementary annotated data, which is
often not available. In this paper, we investigate intermediate pre-training
specifically for RE. We exploit the affinity between syntactic structure and
semantic RE, and identify the syntactic relations which are closely related to
RE by being on the shortest dependency path between two entities. We then take
advantage of the high accuracy of current syntactic parsers in order to
automatically obtain large amounts of low-cost pre-training data. By
pre-training our RE model on the relevant syntactic relations, we are able to
outperform the baseline in five out of six cross-domain setups, without any

Balancing Logit Variation for Long-tailed Semantic Segmentation,0.53828,"Semantic segmentation usually suffers from a long-tail data distribution. Due
to the imbalanced number of samples across categories, the features of those
tail classes may get squeezed into a narrow area in the feature space. Towards
a balanced feature distribution, we introduce category-wise variation into the
network predictions in the training phase such that an instance is no longer
projected to a feature point, but a small region instead. Such a perturbation
is highly dependent on the category scale, which appears as assigning smaller
variation to head classes and larger variation to tail classes. In this way, we
manage to close the gap between the feature areas of different categories,
resulting in a more balanced representation. It is noteworthy that the
introduced variation is discarded at the inference stage to facilitate a
confident prediction. Although with an embarrassingly simple implementation,

Denoising Diffusion Autoencoders are Unified Self-supervised Learners,0.643802,"Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models, which are reminiscent of
denoising autoencoders, we investigate whether they can acquire discriminative

shows that the networks in diffusion models, namely denoising diffusion

unconditional image generation, DDAE has already learned strongly
linear-separable representations within its intermediate layers without
auxiliary encoders, thus making diffusion pre-training emerge as a general
approach for generative-and-discriminative dual learning. To validate this, we
conduct linear probe and fine-tuning evaluations. Our diffusion-based approach
achieves 95.9% and 50.0% linear evaluation accuracies on CIFAR-10 and
Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, and is comparable to contrastive learning and

Patton: Language Model Pretraining on Text-Rich Networks,0.699437,"A real-world text corpus sometimes comprises not only text documents but also

Large quantities of deep learning methods have been proposed to handle various

Implicit Stacked Autoregressive Model for Video Prediction,0.656266,"Future frame prediction has been approached through two primary methods:
autoregressive and non-autoregressive. Autoregressive methods rely on the
Markov assumption and can achieve high accuracy in the early stages of
prediction when errors are not yet accumulated. However, their performance

X-ReID: Cross-Instance Transformer for Identity-Level Person Re-Identification,0.358756,"Currently, most existing person re-identification methods use Instance-Level

fast/complex motions. We propose a novel approach which jointly optimizes a
canonical time and pose configuration, with a pose-dependent motion field and
pose-independent temporal deformations complementing each other. Thanks to our
novel temporal and cyclic consistency constraints along with additional losses
on intermediate representation such as segmentation, our approach provides high

GPT-4 Doesn't Know It's Wrong: An Analysis of Iterative Prompting for Reasoning Problems,0.78489,"There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the initial optimism that reasoning
might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of
counterexamples, a wide spread belief in their iterative self-critique
capabilities persists. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate
the effectiveness of iterative prompting of LLMs in the context of Graph
Coloring, a canonical NP-complete reasoning problem that is related to
propositional satisfiability as well as practical problems like scheduling and
allocation. We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT4
in solving graph coloring instances or verifying the correctness of candidate
colorings. In iterative modes, we experiment with the model critiquing its own
answers and an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions. In both
cases, we analyze whether the content of the criticisms actually affects bottom
line performance. The study seems to indicate that (i) LLMs are bad at solving
graph coloring instances (ii) they are no better at verifying a solution--and
thus are not effective in iterative modes with LLMs critiquing LLM-generated
solutions (iii) the correctness and content of the criticisms--whether by LLMs
or external solvers--seems largely irrelevant to the performance of iterative
prompting. We show that the observed increase in effectiveness is largely due
to the correct solution being fortuitously present in the top-k completions of
the prompt (and being recognized as such by an external verifier). Our results
thus call into question claims about the self-critiquing capabilities of state
of the art LLMs.",None,-1
Toward Verifiable and Reproducible Human Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation,0.614387,"Human evaluation is critical for validating the performance of text-to-image

Unsupervised Synthetic Image Refinement via Contrastive Learning and Consistent Semantic-Structural Constraints,0.377871,"Ensuring the realism of computer-generated synthetic images is crucial to

semantic distortion. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been successfully
used to pull correlated patches together and push uncorrelated ones apart. In
this work, we exploit semantic and structural consistency between synthetic and

Using Artificial Populations to Study Psychological Phenomena in Neural Models,0.0579342,"The recent proliferation of research into transformer based natural language

DiffusionAD: Norm-guided One-step Denoising Diffusion for Anomaly Detection,0.0776775,"Anomaly detection has garnered extensive applications in real industrial
manufacturing due to its remarkable effectiveness and efficiency. However,

models by facilitating anomaly-free restoration. Additionally, we propose a
rapid one-step denoising paradigm, significantly faster than the traditional
iterative denoising in diffusion models. Furthermore, the introduction of the
norm-guided paradigm elevates the accuracy and fidelity of reconstructions. The

P+: Extended Textual Conditioning in Text-to-Image Generation,0.918145,"We introduce an Extended Textual Conditioning space in text-to-image models,

Visual-Language Prompt Tuning with Knowledge-guided Context Optimization,0.864916,"Prompt tuning is an effective way to adapt the pre-trained visual-language
model (VLM) to the downstream task using task-related textual tokens.
Representative CoOp-based work combines the learnable textual tokens with the

textual knowledge is the worse generalization to the unseen classes because it
forgets the essential general textual knowledge having a strong generalization
ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel Knowledge-guided Context
Optimization (KgCoOp) to enhance the generalization ability of the learnable

essential knowledge can be alleviated by reducing the discrepancy between the
learnable prompt and the hand-crafted prompt. Especially, KgCoOp minimizes the
discrepancy between the textual embeddings generated by learned prompts and the
hand-crafted prompts. Finally, adding the KgCoOp upon the contrastive loss can
make a discriminative prompt for both seen and unseen tasks. Extensive

HSCNet++: Hierarchical Scene Coordinate Classification and Regression for Visual Localization with Transformer,0.492002,"Visual localization is critical to many applications in computer vision and

regress the mapping between raw pixels and 3D coordinates in the scene, and
thus the matching is implicitly performed by the forward pass through the

regression task directly can be difficult for a single network. In this work,
we present a new hierarchical scene coordinate network to predict pixel scene

Give Us the Facts: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs for Fact-aware Language Modeling,0.535989,"Recently, ChatGPT, a representative large language model (LLM), has gained

CAT: A Contextualized Conceptualization and Instantiation Framework for Commonsense Reasoning,0.454876,"Commonsense reasoning, aiming at endowing machines with a human-like ability
to make situational presumptions, is extremely challenging to generalize. For
someone who barely knows about ""meditation,"" while is knowledgeable about
""singing,"" he can still infer that ""meditation makes people relaxed"" from the
existing knowledge that ""singing makes people relaxed"" by first conceptualizing
""singing"" as a ""relaxing event"" and then instantiating that event to
""meditation."" This process, known as conceptual induction and deduction, is
fundamental to commonsense reasoning while lacking both labeled data and
methodologies to enhance commonsense modeling. To fill such a research gap, we

Unsupervised Semantic Correspondence Using Stable Diffusion,0.845484,"Text-to-image diffusion models are now capable of generating images that are

knowledge within diffusion models to find semantic correspondences - locations
in multiple images that have the same semantic meaning. Specifically, given an
image, we optimize the prompt embeddings of these models for maximum attention
on the regions of interest. These optimized embeddings capture semantic
information about the location, which can then be transferred to another image.

ZGUL: Zero-shot Generalization to Unseen Languages using Multi-source Ensembling of Language Adapters,0.580708,"We tackle the problem of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in NLP tasks via
the use of language adapters (LAs). Most of the earlier works have explored
training with adapter of a single source (often English), and testing either
using the target LA or LA of another related language. Training target LA
requires unlabeled data, which may not be readily available for low resource
unseen languages: those that are neither seen by the underlying multilingual
language model (e.g., mBERT), nor do we have any (labeled or unlabeled) data
for them. We posit that for more effective cross-lingual transfer, instead of
just one source LA, we need to leverage LAs of multiple (linguistically or
geographically related) source languages, both at train and test-time - which
we investigate via our novel neural architecture, ZGUL. Extensive
experimentation across four language groups, covering 15 unseen target

propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic
information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color,

associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and
cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics

correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property
similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera
trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which

NovPhy: A Testbed for Physical Reasoning in Open-world Environments,0.0457542,"Due to the emergence of AI systems that interact with the physical
environment, there is an increased interest in incorporating physical reasoning
capabilities into those AI systems. But is it enough to only have physical
reasoning capabilities to operate in a real physical environment? In the real
world, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As
humans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations.
Similarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of
novelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment.
To facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed,
NovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the
presence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of
tasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical
scenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties
representing a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly

design, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty
when it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a
physical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a
thorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents.
Our evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents'
performance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform
significantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to
novelties typically adapt slower than humans. We promote the development of
intelligent agents capable of performing at the human level or above when

Memory augment is All You Need for image restoration,0.163482,"Image restoration is a low-level vision task, most CNN methods are designed

specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three
samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve
the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the
learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task

Optimal Transport Posterior Alignment for Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing,0.497749,"Cross-lingual semantic parsing transfers parsing capability from a
high-resource language (e.g., English) to low-resource languages with scarce

parsing by explicitly minimizing cross-lingual divergence between probabilistic
latent variables using Optimal Transport. We demonstrate how this direct
guidance improves parsing from natural languages using fewer examples and less
training. We evaluate our method on two datasets, MTOP and MultiATIS++SQL,

Automatic Readability Assessment for Closely Related Languages,0.906605,"In recent years, the main focus of research on automatic readability
assessment (ARA) has shifted towards using expensive deep learning-based
methods with the primary goal of increasing models' accuracy. This, however, is
rarely applicable for low-resource languages where traditional handcrafted
features are still widely used due to the lack of existing NLP tools to extract
deeper linguistic representations. In this work, we take a step back from the
technical component and focus on how linguistic aspects such as mutual
intelligibility or degree of language relatedness can improve ARA in a
low-resource setting. We collect short stories written in three languages in
the Philippines-Tagalog, Bikol, and Cebuano-to train readability assessment
models and explore the interaction of data and features in various
cross-lingual setups. Our results show that the inclusion of CrossNGO, a novel
specialized feature exploiting n-gram overlap applied to languages with high
mutual intelligibility, significantly improves the performance of ARA models

AFPN: Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection,0.829378,"Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale
variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature
extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid
networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of
feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This
paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct
interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent
low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into
the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent
levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information
conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive
spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies.
We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object
detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test

Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models to Construct and Utilize World Models for Model-based Task Planning,0.999393,"There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models
(LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as
planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited
correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with
simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing
human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that
constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition
language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent
planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional
PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources
of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack
a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural
language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying
domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered
by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users
to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and
correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous
work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than
commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be
leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the
corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging

Investigating the Effectiveness of Task-Agnostic Prefix Prompt for Instruction Following,0.344509,"In this paper, we present our finding that prepending a Task-Agnostic Prefix
Prompt (TAPP) to the input improves the instruction-following ability of
various Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. TAPP is different from
canonical prompts for LLMs in that it is a fixed prompt prepended to the
beginning of every input regardless of the target task for zero-shot
generalization. We observe that both base LLMs (i.e. not fine-tuned to follow
instructions) and instruction-tuned models benefit from TAPP, resulting in
34.58% and 12.26% improvement on average, respectively. This implies that the
instruction-following ability of LLMs can be improved during inference time
with a fixed prompt constructed with simple heuristics. We hypothesize that
TAPP assists language models to better estimate the output distribution by
focusing more on the instruction of the target task during inference. In other
words, such ability does not seem to be sufficiently activated in not only base
LLMs but also many instruction-fine-tuned LLMs. All experiments are

Uncertainty-Aware AB3DMOT by Variational 3D Object Detection,0.112084,"Autonomous driving needs to rely on high-quality 3D object detection to

Network-based TANet 3D object detector to generate 3D object detections with
uncertainty and introduce these detections to an uncertainty-aware AB3DMOT
tracker. This is done by applying a linear transformation to the estimated
uncertainty matrix, which is subsequently used as a measurement noise for the
adopted Kalman filter. We implement two ways to estimate output uncertainty,
i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNN outputs and then
propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by
associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the
covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external

Behind the Scenes: Density Fields for Single View Reconstruction,0.79327,"Inferring a meaningful geometric scene representation from a single image is
a fundamental problem in computer vision. Approaches based on traditional depth
map prediction can only reason about areas that are visible in the image.

color from the available views instead of storing color in the density field,
our scene representation becomes significantly less complex compared to NeRFs,
and a neural network can predict it in a single forward pass. The prediction
network is trained through self-supervision from only video data. Our
formulation allows volume rendering to perform both depth prediction and novel

Comparing Psychometric and Behavioral Predictors of Compliance During Human-AI Interactions,0.0963258,"Optimization of human-AI teams hinges on the AI's ability to tailor its
interaction to individual human teammates. A common hypothesis in adaptive AI
research is that minor differences in people's predisposition to trust can
significantly impact their likelihood of complying with recommendations from
the AI. Predisposition to trust is often measured with self-report inventories
that are administered before interactions. We benchmark a popular measure of
this kind against behavioral predictors of compliance. We find that the
inventory is a less effective predictor of compliance than the behavioral
measures in datasets taken from three previous research projects. This suggests
a general property that individual differences in initial behavior are more
predictive than differences in self-reported trust attitudes. This result also
shows a potential for easily accessible behavioral measures to provide an AI
with more accurate models without the use of (often costly) survey instruments.",None,-1
Glancing Future for Simultaneous Machine Translation,0.541831,"Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs translation while reading the
source sentence. Unlike conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) training,
existing SiMT methods adopt the prefix-to-prefix (prefix2prefix) training,
where the model predicts target tokens based on partial source tokens. However,
the prefix2prefix training diminishes the ability of the model to capture
global information and introduces forced predictions due to the absence of
essential source information. Consequently, it is crucial to bridge the gap
between the prefix2prefix training and seq2seq training to enhance the
translation capability of the SiMT model. In this paper, we propose a novel
method that glances future in curriculum learning to achieve the transition
from the seq2seq training to prefix2prefix training. Specifically, we gradually
reduce the available source information from the whole sentence to the prefix
corresponding to that latency. Our method is applicable to a wide range of SiMT

CoReFace: Sample-Guided Contrastive Regularization for Deep Face Recognition,0.588239,"The discriminability of feature representation is the key to open-set face
recognition. Previous methods rely on the learnable weights of the
classification layer that represent the identities. However, the evaluation
process learns no identity representation and drops the classifier from
training. This inconsistency could confuse the feature encoder in understanding
the evaluation goal and hinder the effect of identity-based methods. To
alleviate the above problem, we propose a novel approach namely Contrastive
Regularization for Face recognition (CoReFace) to apply image-level
regularization in feature representation learning. Specifically, we employ
sample-guided contrastive learning to regularize the training with the
image-image relationship directly, which is consistent with the evaluation
process. To integrate contrastive learning into face recognition, we augment
embeddings instead of images to avoid the image quality degradation. Then, we
propose a novel contrastive loss for the representation distribution by
incorporating an adaptive margin and a supervised contrastive mask to generate
steady loss values and avoid the collision with the classification supervision

Multitask Prompt Tuning Enables Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning,0.881903,"Prompt tuning, in which a base pretrained model is adapted to each task via

from multiple task-specific source prompts. We then learn multiplicative low
rank updates to this shared prompt to efficiently adapt it to each downstream

Investigations on convergence behaviour of Physics Informed Neural Networks across spectral ranges and derivative orders,0.256368,"An important inference from Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory is the
existence of spectral bias (SB), that is, low frequency components of the

is established for Mean Square Error (MSE) loss functions with very low
learning rate parameters. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are designed
to learn the solutions of differential equations (DE) of arbitrary orders; in
PINNs the loss functions are obtained as the residues of the conservative form
of the DEs and represent the degree of dissatisfaction of the equations. So
there has been an open question whether (a) PINNs also exhibit SB and (b) if
so, how does this bias vary across the orders of the DEs. In this work, a
series of numerical experiments are conducted on simple sinusoidal functions of
varying frequencies, compositions and equation orders to investigate these
issues. It is firmly established that under normalized conditions, PINNs do

A Theory of Bounded Inductive Rationality,0.811881,"The dominant theories of rational choice assume logical omniscience. That is,
they assume that when facing a decision problem, an agent can perform all
relevant computations and determine the truth value of all relevant
logical/mathematical claims. This assumption is unrealistic when, for example,
we offer bets on remote digits of pi or when an agent faces a computationally
intractable planning problem. Furthermore, the assumption of logical
omniscience creates contradictions in cases where the environment can contain
descriptions of the agent itself. Importantly, strategic interactions as
studied in game theory are decision problems in which a rational agent is
predicted by its environment (the other players). In this paper, we develop a
theory of rational decision making that does not assume logical omniscience. We
consider agents who repeatedly face decision problems (including ones like
betting on digits of pi or games against other agents). The main contribution
of this paper is to provide a sensible theory of rationality for such agents.
Roughly, we require that a boundedly rational inductive agent tests each
efficiently computable hypothesis infinitely often and follows those hypotheses
that keep their promises of high rewards. We then prove that agents that are
rational in this sense have other desirable properties. For example, they learn
to value random and pseudo-random lotteries at their expected reward. Finally,
we consider strategic interactions between different agents and prove a folk

Errors are Robustly Tamed in Cumulative Knowledge Processes,0.249199,"We study processes of societal knowledge accumulation, where the validity of

difficulty is progressively increased with each new phase by adding one more
concept per caption. Correspondingly, the knowledge acquired in each learning
phase is utilized in subsequent phases to effectively constrain the learning

annotations'', which leads to efficient scribble forms via supervision
maximization and randomness simulation. Furthermore, we introduce
regularization terms to encode the spatial relationship and shape prior, where
a new formulation is developed to estimate the mixture ratios of label classes.
These ratios are critical in identifying the unlabeled pixels for each class

foundation for the incorporation of spatial prior. Finally, we integrate the

PIVOINE: Instruction Tuning for Open-world Information Extraction,0.660573,"We consider the problem of Open-world Information Extraction (Open-world IE),
which extracts comprehensive entity profiles from unstructured texts. Different
from the conventional closed-world setting of Information Extraction (IE),
Open-world IE considers a more general situation where entities and relations
could be beyond a predefined ontology. More importantly, we seek to develop a
large language model (LLM) that is able to perform Open-world IE to extract
desirable entity profiles characterized by (possibly fine-grained) natural
language instructions. We achieve this by finetuning LLMs using instruction
tuning. In particular, we construct INSTRUCTOPENWIKI, a substantial instruction
tuning dataset for Open-world IE enriched with a comprehensive corpus,
extensive annotations, and diverse instructions. We finetune the pretrained
BLOOM models on INSTRUCTOPENWIKI and obtain PIVOINE, an LLM for Open-world IE

that PIVOINE significantly outperforms traditional closed-world methods and
other LLM baselines, displaying impressive generalization capabilities on both

How Well Do Large Language Models Understand Syntax? An Evaluation by Asking Natural Language Questions,0.0443385,"While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) bring us closer to
achieving artificial general intelligence, the question persists: Do LLMs truly
understand language, or do they merely mimic comprehension through pattern
recognition? This study seeks to explore this question through the lens of
syntax, a crucial component of sentence comprehension. Adopting a natural
language question-answering (Q&A) scheme, we craft questions targeting nine
syntactic knowledge points that are most closely related to sentence
comprehension. Experiments conducted on 24 LLMs suggest that most have a
limited grasp of syntactic knowledge, exhibiting notable discrepancies across
different syntactic knowledge points. In particular, questions involving
prepositional phrase attachment pose the greatest challenge, whereas those
concerning adjectival modifier and indirect object are relatively easier for
LLMs to handle. Furthermore, a case study on the training dynamics of the LLMs
reveals that the majority of syntactic knowledge is learned during the initial
stages of training, hinting that simply increasing the number of training
tokens may not be the `silver bullet' for improving the comprehension ability
of LLMs.",None,-1
A Unified One-Step Solution for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction,0.29926,"Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) is a challenging yet significant
subtask in aspect-based sentiment analysis as it provides a complete
aspect-level sentiment structure. However, existing ASQP datasets are usually
small and low-density, hindering technical advancement. To expand the capacity,
in this paper, we release two new datasets for ASQP, which contain the
following characteristics: larger size, more words per sample, and higher
density. With such datasets, we unveil the shortcomings of existing strong ASQP
baselines and therefore propose a unified one-step solution for ASQP, namely
One-ASQP, to detect the aspect categories and to identify the
aspect-opinion-sentiment (AOS) triplets simultaneously. Our One-ASQP holds
several unique advantages: (1) by separating ASQP into two subtasks and solving
them independently and simultaneously, we can avoid error propagation in
pipeline-based methods and overcome slow training and inference in
generation-based methods; (2) by introducing sentiment-specific horns tagging
schema in a token-pair-based two-dimensional matrix, we can exploit deeper
interactions between sentiment elements and efficiently decode the AOS
triplets; (3) we design ``[NULL]'' token can help us effectively identify the
implicit aspects or opinions. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and our

On the Importance of Noise Scheduling for Diffusion Models,0.69145,"We empirically study the effect of noise scheduling strategies for denoising

is crucial for the performance, and the optimal one depends on the task (e.g.,
image sizes), (2) when increasing the image size, the optimal noise scheduling
shifts towards a noisier one (due to increased redundancy in pixels), and (3)
simply scaling the input data by a factor of $b$ while keeping the noise
schedule function fixed (equivalent to shifting the logSNR by $\log b$) is a
good strategy across image sizes. This simple recipe, when combined with
recently proposed Recurrent Interface Network (RIN), yields state-of-the-art

Consistent Multi-Granular Rationale Extraction for Explainable Multi-hop Fact Verification,0.331872,"The success of deep learning models on multi-hop fact verification has

CAMS: CAnonicalized Manipulation Spaces for Category-Level Functional Hand-Object Manipulation Synthesis,0.947794,"In this work, we focus on a novel task of category-level functional
hand-object manipulation synthesis covering both rigid and articulated object
categories. Given an object geometry, an initial human hand pose as well as a
sparse control sequence of object poses, our goal is to generate a physically
reasonable hand-object manipulation sequence that performs like human beings.
To address such a challenge, we first design CAnonicalized Manipulation Spaces
(CAMS), a two-level space hierarchy that canonicalizes the hand poses in an
object-centric and contact-centric view. Benefiting from the representation
capability of CAMS, we then present a two-stage framework for synthesizing
human-like manipulation animations. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both rigid and articulated categories with impressive visual
effects. Codes and video results can be found at our project homepage:

Linearity of Relation Decoding in Transformer Language Models,0.797188,"Much of the knowledge encoded in transformer language models (LMs) may be
expressed in terms of relations: relations between words and their synonyms,
entities and their attributes, etc. We show that, for a subset of relations,
this computation is well-approximated by a single linear transformation on the
subject representation. Linear relation representations may be obtained by
constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and
they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations.
However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational
knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their
representations. Our results thus reveal a simple, interpretable, but
heterogeneously deployed knowledge representation strategy in transformer LMs.",None,-1

Towards Compute-Optimal Transfer Learning,0.0354698,"The field of transfer learning is undergoing a significant shift with the
introduction of large pretrained models which have demonstrated strong
adaptability to a variety of downstream tasks. However, the high computational
and memory requirements to finetune or use these models can be a hindrance to
their widespread use. In this study, we present a solution to this issue by
proposing a simple yet effective way to trade computational efficiency for
asymptotic performance which we define as the performance a learning algorithm
achieves as compute tends to infinity. Specifically, we argue that zero-shot
structured pruning of pretrained models allows them to increase compute
efficiency with minimal reduction in performance. We evaluate our method on the
Nevis'22 continual learning benchmark that offers a diverse set of transfer
scenarios. Our results show that pruning convolutional filters of pretrained
models can lead to more than 20% performance improvement in low computational
regimes.",None,-1
On the Local Cache Update Rules in Streaming Federated Learning,0.121348,"In this study, we address the emerging field of Streaming Federated Learning
(SFL) and propose local cache update rules to manage dynamic data distributions
and limited cache capacity. Traditional federated learning relies on fixed data
sets, whereas in SFL, data is streamed, and its distribution changes over time,
leading to discrepancies between the local training dataset and long-term
distribution. To mitigate this problem, we propose three local cache update
rules - First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Static Ratio Selective Replacement (SRSR),
and Dynamic Ratio Selective Replacement (DRSR) - that update the local cache of
each client while considering the limited cache capacity. Furthermore, we
derive a convergence bound for our proposed SFL algorithm as a function of the
distribution discrepancy between the long-term data distribution and the
client's local training dataset. We then evaluate our proposed algorithm on two
datasets: a network traffic classification dataset and an image classification
dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed local cache
update rules significantly reduce the distribution discrepancy and outperform
the baseline methods. Our study advances the field of SFL and provides
practical cache management solutions in federated learning.",None,-1
Can ChatGPT Understand Too? A Comparative Study on ChatGPT and Fine-tuned BERT,0.980705,"Recently, ChatGPT has attracted great attention, as it can generate fluent

Mask3D: Pre-training 2D Vision Transformers by Learning Masked 3D Priors,0.604992,"Current popular backbones in computer vision, such as Vision Transformers

more effectively understand 3D structural priors in 2D backbones, we propose
Mask3D to leverage existing large-scale RGB-D data in a self-supervised
pre-training to embed these 3D priors into 2D learned feature representations.
In contrast to traditional 3D contrastive learning paradigms requiring 3D
reconstructions or multi-view correspondences, our approach is simple: we
formulate a pre-text reconstruction task by masking RGB and depth patches in
individual RGB-D frames. We demonstrate the Mask3D is particularly effective in
embedding 3D priors into the powerful 2D ViT backbone, enabling improved
representation learning for various scene understanding tasks, such as semantic
segmentation, instance segmentation and object detection. Experiments show that
Mask3D notably outperforms existing self-supervised 3D pre-training approaches

TransPose: A Transformer-based 6D Object Pose Estimation Network with Depth Refinement,0.362689,"As demand for robotics manipulation application increases, accurate
vision-based 6D pose estimation becomes essential for autonomous operations.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based approaches for pose estimation have
been previously introduced. However, the quest for better performance still
persists especially for accurate robotics manipulation. This quest extends to
the Agri-robotics domain. In this paper, we propose TransPose, an improved
Transformer-based 6D pose estimation with a depth refinement module. The
architecture takes in only an RGB image as input with no additional
supplementing modalities such as depth or thermal images. The architecture
encompasses an innovative lighter depth estimation network that estimates depth
from an RGB image using feature pyramid with an up-sampling method. A
transformer-based detection network with additional prediction heads is
proposed to directly regress the object's centre and predict the 6D pose of the
target. A novel depth refinement module is then used alongside the predicted
centers, 6D poses and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated 6D

CHiLL: Zero-shot Custom Interpretable Feature Extraction from Clinical Notes with Large Language Models,0.611815,"We propose CHiLL (Crafting High-Level Latents), an approach for
natural-language specification of features for linear models. CHiLL prompts
LLMs with expert-crafted queries to generate interpretable features from health
records. The resulting noisy labels are then used to train a simple linear
classifier. Generating features based on queries to an LLM can empower
physicians to use their domain expertise to craft features that are clinically
meaningful for a downstream task of interest, without having to manually
extract these from raw EHR. We are motivated by a real-world risk prediction
task, but as a reproducible proxy, we use MIMIC-III and MIMIC-CXR data and
standard predictive tasks (e.g., 30-day readmission) to evaluate this approach.
We find that linear models using automatically extracted features are
comparably performant to models using reference features, and provide greater
interpretability than linear models using ""Bag-of-Words"" features. We verify
that learned feature weights align well with clinical expectations.",None,-1
A Refutation of Shapley Values for Explainability,0.103204,"Recent work demonstrated the existence of Boolean functions for which Shapley
values provide misleading information about the relative importance of features
in rule-based explanations. Such misleading information was broadly categorized
into a number of possible issues. Each of those issues relates with features
being relevant or irrelevant for a prediction, and all are significant
regarding the inadequacy of Shapley values for rule-based explainability. This
earlier work devised a brute-force approach to identify Boolean functions,
defined on small numbers of features, and also associated instances, which
displayed such inadequacy-revealing issues, and so served as evidence to the
inadequacy of Shapley values for rule-based explainability. However, an
outstanding question is how frequently such inadequacy-revealing issues can
occur for Boolean functions with arbitrary large numbers of features. It is
plain that a brute-force approach would be unlikely to provide insights on how
to tackle this question. This paper answers the above question by proving that,
for any number of features, there exist Boolean functions that exhibit one or
more inadequacy-revealing issues, thereby contributing decisive arguments
against the use of Shapley values as the theoretical underpinning of
feature-attribution methods in explainability.",None,-1
Neural Spectro-polarimetric Fields,0.85507,"Modeling the spatial radiance distribution of light rays in a scene has been
extensively explored for applications, including view synthesis. Spectrum and
polarization, the wave properties of light, are often neglected due to their
integration into three RGB spectral bands and their non-perceptibility to human

and geometric information about a scene. Here, we propose to model
spectro-polarimetric fields, the spatial Stokes-vector distribution of any
light ray at an arbitrary wavelength. We present Neural Spectro-polarimetric
Fields (NeSpoF), a neural representation that models the physically-valid
Stokes vector at given continuous variables of position, direction, and
wavelength. NeSpoF manages inherently noisy raw measurements, showcases memory
efficiency, and preserves physically vital signals - factors that are crucial
for representing the high-dimensional signal of a spectro-polarimetric field.
To validate NeSpoF, we introduce the first multi-view

VesselVAE: Recursive Variational Autoencoders for 3D Blood Vessel Synthesis,0.453255,"We present a data-driven generative framework for synthesizing blood vessel
3D geometry. This is a challenging task due to the complexity of vascular

low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry
features describing the target surface. After training, the VesselVAE latent
space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. To the best of our

Towards Local Visual Modeling for Image Captioning,0.738976,"In this paper, we study the local visual modeling with grid features for
image captioning, which is critical for generating accurate and detailed

its neighbors. It reduces the difficulty of local object recognition during
captioning. LSF is used for inter-layer information fusion, which aggregates
the information of different encoder layers for cross-layer semantical
complementarity. With these two novel designs, the proposed LSTNet can model
the local visual information of grid features to improve the captioning
quality. To validate LSTNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the

Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection,0.802379,"Reconstruction-based anomaly detection models achieve their purpose by
suppressing the generalization ability for anomaly. However, diverse normal

Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection (DMAD) framework to enhance
reconstruction diversity while avoid the undesired generalization on anomalies.
To this end, we design Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM), which models diverse
normals and measures the severity of anomaly by estimating multi-scale
deformation fields from reconstructed reference to original input. Integrated
with an information compression module, PDM essentially decouples deformation
from prototypical embedding and makes the final anomaly score more reliable.
Experimental results on both surveillance videos and industrial images

well in front of contaminated data and anomaly-like normal samples.",None,-1
Using a Waffle Iron for Automotive Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,0.887438,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds in autonomous driving datasets requires

Regularization of polynomial networks for image recognition,0.148266,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have obtained impressive performance across

further motivate the regularization schemes, we introduce D-PolyNets that

Unsupervised Learning of Robust Spectral Shape Matching,0.801059,"We propose a novel learning-based approach for robust 3D shape matching. Our

Pure Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization,0.859653,"Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are the best
algorithms so far for solving large-scale incomplete information games.

iteration is too high; Secondly, the game characteristics in the real world are
different. Just using one CFR algorithm will not be perfectly suitable for all
game problems.
  For these two problems, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Pure CFR

Play (FP), inheriting the concept of counterfactual regret (value) from CFR,
and using the best response strategy instead of the regret matching strategy
for the next iteration. This algorithm has three advantages. First, PCFR can be
combined with any CFR variant. The resulting Pure MCCFR (PMCCFR) can
significantly reduce the time and space complexity of one iteration. Secondly,
our experiments show that the convergence speed of the PMCCFR is 2$\sim$3 times
that of the MCCFR. Finally, there is a type of game that is very suitable for

Hubs and Hyperspheres: Reducing Hubness and Improving Transductive Few-shot Learning with Hyperspherical Embeddings,0.296712,"Distance-based classification is frequently used in transductive few-shot

hubs from one class appear often among the nearest neighbors of points from
another class, degrading the classifier's performance. To address the hubness
problem in FSL, we first prove that hubness can be eliminated by distributing
representations uniformly on the hypersphere. We then propose two new
approaches to embed representations on the hypersphere, which we prove optimize

discovery and materials design. Recently, the combination of ML-based
single-step reaction predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising
results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to
optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here,
we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor,
by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we
propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value
Networks (PDVN), which alternates between the planning phase and updating
phase. In PDVN, we construct two separate value networks to predict the
synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the
single-step accuracy, we design a two-branch network structure for the
single-step predictor. On the widely-used USPTO dataset, our PDVN algorithm
improves the search success rate of existing multi-step planners (e.g.,
increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro*, and reducing the
number of model calls by half while solving 99.47% molecules for RetroGraph).
Additionally, PDVN helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing the
average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro*, and from 5.63 to 4.78 for
RetroGraph). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/DiXue98/PDVN}.",None,-1
Strategize Before Teaching: A Conversational Tutoring System with Pedagogy Self-Distillation,0.728035,"Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) aim to help students master
educational material with natural language interaction in the form of a dialog.
CTSs have become a key pillar in educational data mining research. A key
challenge in CTSs is to engage the student in the conversation while exposing
them to a diverse set of teaching strategies, akin to a human teacher, thereby,
helping them learn in the process. Different from previous work that generates
responses given the strategies as input, we propose to jointly predict teaching
strategies and generate tutor responses accordingly, which fits a more
realistic application scenario. We benchmark several competitive models on
three dialog tutoring datasets and propose a unified framework that combines
teaching response generation and pedagogical strategy prediction, where a
self-distillation mechanism is adopted to guide the teaching strategy learning

Bidirectional Generative Framework for Cross-domain Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,0.702697,"Cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to perform various
fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks on a target domain by transferring
knowledge from a source domain. Since labeled data only exists in the source
domain, a model is expected to bridge the domain gap for tackling cross-domain
ABSA. Though domain adaptation methods have proven to be effective, most of
them are based on a discriminative model, which needs to be specifically
designed for different ABSA tasks. To offer a more general solution, we propose
a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain
ABSA tasks. Specifically, our framework trains a generative model in both
text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task
into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter
generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which
a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on four
cross-domain ABSA tasks and present new state-of-the-art results on all tasks.

Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion Via Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering,0.510248,"The nodes in the commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) are normally represented
by free-form short text (e.g., word or phrase). Different nodes may represent
the same concept. This leads to the problems of edge sparsity and node
redundancy, which challenges CSKG representation and completion. On the one
hand, edge sparsity limits the performance of graph representation learning; On
the other hand, node redundancy makes different nodes corresponding to the same
concept have inconsistent relations with other nodes. To address the two
problems, we propose a new CSKG completion framework based on Contrastive
Pretraining and Node Clustering (CPNC). Contrastive Pretraining constructs
positive and negative head-tail node pairs on CSKG and utilizes contrastive
learning to obtain better semantic node representation. Node Clustering
aggregates nodes with the same concept into a latent concept, assisting the
task of CSKG completion. We evaluate our CPNC approach on two CSKG completion
benchmarks (CN-100K and ATOMIC), where CPNC outperforms the state-of-the-art

Expanding Scope: Adapting English Adversarial Attacks to Chinese,0.248114,"Recent studies have revealed that NLP predictive models are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Most existing studies focused on designing attacks to
evaluate the robustness of NLP models in the English language alone. Literature

SOTA adversarial attack algorithms in English to the Chinese language. Our
experiments show that attack methods previously applied to English NLP can
generate high-quality adversarial examples in Chinese when combined with proper

Consistent Multimodal Generation via A Unified GAN Framework,0.0459328,"We investigate how to generate multimodal image outputs, such as RGB, depth,

Hyper-Decision Transformer for Efficient Online Policy Adaptation,0.965957,"Decision Transformers (DT) have demonstrated strong performances in offline
reinforcement learning settings, but quickly adapting to unseen novel tasks
remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework,
called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks
from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To
achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation
module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering
unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and
initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT
to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module.
We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We
find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT
parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the whole DT
model. Finally, we explore a more challenging setting where expert actions are
not available, and we show that HDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in

D-Separation for Causal Self-Explanation,0.412553,"Rationalization is a self-explaining framework for NLP models. Conventional
work typically uses the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion to find the
rationale that is most indicative of the target label. However, this criterion
can be influenced by spurious features that correlate with the causal rationale

criterion, we propose a novel criterion to uncover the causal rationale, termed
the Minimum Conditional Dependence (MCD) criterion, which is grounded on our
finding that the non-causal features and the target label are
\emph{d-separated} by the causal rationale. By minimizing the dependence
between the unselected parts of the input and the target label conditioned on
the selected rationale candidate, all the causes of the label are compelled to
be selected. In this study, we employ a simple and practical measure of

Think Rationally about What You See: Continuous Rationale Extraction for Relation Extraction,0.782246,"Relation extraction (RE) aims to extract potential relations according to the

preserve relevant content and remove noisy segments from sentences is a crucial
task. In addition, retained content needs to be fluent enough to maintain
semantic coherence and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel
rationale extraction framework named RE2, which leverages two continuity and
sparsity factors to obtain relevant and coherent rationales from sentences. To

InstantBooth: Personalized Text-to-Image Generation without Test-Time Finetuning,0.979533,"Recent advances in personalized image generation allow a pre-trained
text-to-image model to learn a new concept from a set of images. However,
existing personalization approaches usually require heavy test-time finetuning
for each concept, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale. We propose
InstantBooth, a novel approach built upon pre-trained text-to-image models that
enables instant text-guided image personalization without any test-time
finetuning. We achieve this with several major components. First, we learn the
general concept of the input images by converting them to a textual token with
a learnable image encoder. Second, to keep the fine details of the identity, we
learn rich visual feature representation by introducing a few adapter layers to
the pre-trained model. We train our components only on text-image pairs without
using paired images of the same concept. Compared to test-time finetuning-based
methods like DreamBooth and Textual-Inversion, our model can generate
competitive results on unseen concepts concerning language-image alignment,
image fidelity, and identity preservation while being 100 times faster.",None,-1
Inferring Preferences from Demonstrations in Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning: A Dynamic Weight-based Approach,0.198318,"Many decision-making problems feature multiple objectives. In such problems,
it is not always possible to know the preferences of a decision-maker for
different objectives. However, it is often possible to observe the behavior of
decision-makers. In multi-objective decision-making, preference inference is
the process of inferring the preferences of a decision-maker for different
objectives. This research proposes a Dynamic Weight-based Preference Inference
(DWPI) algorithm that can infer the preferences of agents acting in
multi-objective decision-making problems, based on observed behavior
trajectories in the environment. The proposed method is evaluated on three
multi-objective Markov decision processes: Deep Sea Treasure, Traffic, and Item
Gathering. The performance of the proposed DWPI approach is compared to two
existing preference inference methods from the literature, and empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the baseline
algorithms, in terms of both time requirements and accuracy of the inferred
preferences. The Dynamic Weight-based Preference Inference algorithm also
maintains its performance when inferring preferences for sub-optimal behavior
demonstrations. In addition to its impressive performance, the Dynamic
Weight-based Preference Inference algorithm does not require any interactions
during training with the agent whose preferences are inferred, all that is
required is a trajectory of observed behavior.",None,-1

Stackelberg game where the principal and the agent have different reward
functions, and the agent chooses an MDP policy for both players. The principal
offers an additional reward to the agent, and the agent picks their policy

Medical Face Masks and Emotion Recognition from the Body: Insights from a Deep Learning Perspective,0.110063,"The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly changed the standards and affected all
aspects of our lives, especially social communication. It has forced people to

insightful studies about the effect of face occlusion on emotion recognition

masked face. We utilize a deep learning model based on the Temporal Segment
Network framework, and aspire to fully overcome the face mask consequences.
Although facial and bodily features can be learned from a single input, this
may lead to irrelevant information confusion. By processing those features
separately and fusing their prediction scores, we are more effectively taking

Householder Projector for Unsupervised Latent Semantics Discovery,0.733369,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially the recent style-based
generators (StyleGANs), have versatile semantics in the structured latent

such that only one factor varies during the traversal. Recently, an
unsupervised method proposed a promising direction to directly use the
eigenvectors of the projection matrix that maps latent codes to features as the
interpretable directions. However, one overlooked fact is that the projection
matrix is non-orthogonal and the number of eigenvectors is too large. The
non-orthogonality would entangle semantic attributes in the top few
eigenvectors, and the large dimensionality might result in meaningless
variations among the directions even if the matrix is orthogonal. To avoid
these issues, we propose Householder Projector, a flexible and general low-rank
orthogonal matrix representation based on Householder transformations, to
parameterize the projection matrix. The orthogonality guarantees that the
eigenvectors correspond to disentangled interpretable semantics, while the
low-rank property encourages that each identified direction has meaningful
variations. We integrate our projector into pre-trained StyleGAN2/StyleGAN3 and

SPEED: Speculative Pipelined Execution for Efficient Decoding,0.4657,"Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture
have recently emerged as a dominant foundation model for a wide range of
Natural Language Processing tasks. Nevertheless, their application in real-time

autoregressive nature of generative LLM inference, where tokens are generated
sequentially since each token depends on all previous output tokens. It is
therefore challenging to achieve any token-level parallelism, making inference
extremely memory-bound. In this work, we propose SPEED, which improves
inference efficiency by speculatively executing multiple future tokens in
parallel with the current token using predicted values based on early-layer
hidden states. For Transformer decoders that employ parameter sharing, the
memory operations for the tokens executing in parallel can be amortized, which

Depth-NeuS: Neural Implicit Surfaces Learning for Multi-view Reconstruction Based on Depth Information Optimization,0.228761,"Recently, methods for neural surface representation and rendering, for

surface normals to represent implicit surfaces without using depth information.
Therefore, these methods cannot model the detailed surface features of objects
well. To address this problem, we propose a neural implicit surface learning

Assignment CBS (ITA-CBS) to bypass these two computational bottlenecks. ITA-CBS
generates only a single search tree and avoids computing K-best assignments by
incrementally computing new 1-best assignments during the search. We show that,
in theory, ITA-CBS is guaranteed to find an optimal solution and, in practice,
is computationally efficient.",None,-1
Multiparticle Kalman filter for object localization in symmetric environments,0.397605,"This study considers the object localization problem and proposes a novel
multiparticle Kalman filter to solve it in complex and symmetric environments.
Two well-known classes of filtering algorithms to solve the localization
problem are Kalman filter-based methods and particle filter-based methods. We
consider these classes, demonstrate their complementary properties, and propose
a novel filtering algorithm that takes the best from two classes. We evaluate
the multiparticle Kalman filter in symmetric and noisy environments. Such
environments are especially challenging for both classes of classical methods.
We compare the proposed approach with the particle filter since only this
method is feasible if the initial state is unknown. In the considered
challenging environments, our method outperforms the particle filter in terms
of both localization error and runtime.",None,-1
Diagnosing and Rectifying Vision Models using Language,0.648431,"Recent multi-modal contrastive learning models have demonstrated the ability
to learn an embedding space suitable for building strong vision classifiers, by
leveraging the rich information in large-scale image-caption datasets. Our work
highlights a distinct advantage of this multi-modal embedding space: the
ability to diagnose vision classifiers through natural language. The
traditional process of diagnosing model behaviors in deployment settings
involves labor-intensive data acquisition and annotation. Our proposed method
can discover high-error data slices, identify influential attributes and
further rectify undesirable model behaviors, without requiring any visual data.
Through a combination of theoretical explanation and empirical verification, we
present conditions under which classifiers trained on embeddings from one
modality can be equivalently applied to embeddings from another modality. On a
range of image datasets with known error slices, we demonstrate that our method
can effectively identify the error slices and influential attributes, and can
further use language to rectify failure modes of the classifier.",None,-1
SpellMapper: A non-autoregressive neural spellchecker for ASR customization with candidate retrieval based on n-gram mappings,0.798104,"Contextual spelling correction models are an alternative to shallow fusion to
improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) quality given user vocabulary. To
deal with large user vocabularies, most of these models include candidate
retrieval mechanisms, usually based on minimum edit distance between fragments
of ASR hypothesis and user phrases. However, the edit-distance approach is
slow, non-trainable, and may have low recall as it relies only on common
letters. We propose: 1) a novel algorithm for candidate retrieval, based on
misspelled n-gram mappings, which gives up to 90% recall with just the top 10

ISP: Multi-Layered Garment Draping with Implicit Sewing Patterns,0.974197,"Many approaches to draping individual garments on human body models are
realistic, fast, and yield outputs that are differentiable with respect to the

bodies in T-pose. In this paper, we introduce a parametric garment
representation model that addresses these limitations. As in models used by
clothing designers, each garment consists of individual 2D panels. Their 2D
shape is defined by a Signed Distance Function and 3D shape by a 2D to 3D
mapping. The 2D parameterization enables easy detection of potential collisions
and the 3D parameterization handles complex shapes effectively. We show that
this combination is faster and yields higher quality reconstructions than
purely implicit surface representations, and makes the recovery of layered

vox2vec: A Framework for Self-supervised Contrastive Learning of Voxel-level Representations in Medical Images,0.216436,"This paper introduces vox2vec - a contrastive method for self-supervised
learning (SSL) of voxel-level representations. vox2vec representations are
modeled by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN): a voxel representation is a
concatenation of the corresponding feature vectors from different pyramid
levels. The FPN is pre-trained to produce similar representations for the same
voxel in different augmented contexts and distinctive representations for
different voxels. This results in unified multi-scale representations that
capture both global semantics (e.g., body part) and local semantics (e.g.,
different small organs or healthy versus tumor tissue). We use vox2vec to
pre-train a FPN on more than 6500 publicly available computed tomography
images. We evaluate the pre-trained representations by attaching simple heads
on top of them and training the resulting models for 22 segmentation tasks. We
show that vox2vec outperforms existing medical imaging SSL techniques in three
evaluation setups: linear and non-linear probing and end-to-end fine-tuning.
Moreover, a non-linear head trained on top of the frozen vox2vec
representations achieves competitive performance with the FPN trained from

Interactive Segment Anything NeRF with Feature Imitation,0.64827,"This paper investigates the potential of enhancing Neural Radiance Fields

zero-shot semantic segmentation with NeRF. Our framework reformulates the
segmentation process by directly rendering semantic features and only applying
the decoder from perception models. This eliminates the need for expensive
backbones and benefits 3D consistency. Furthermore, we can project the learned

linguistic invariances created by shared meanings. Our method is unsupervised,

SMATCH++: Standardized and Extended Evaluation of Semantic Graphs,0.741204,"The Smatch metric is a popular method for evaluating graph distances, as is
necessary, for instance, to assess the performance of semantic graph parsing
systems. However, we observe some issues in the metric that jeopardize
meaningful evaluation. E.g., opaque pre-processing choices can affect results,
and current graph-alignment solvers do not provide us with upper-bounds.
Without upper-bounds, however, fair evaluation is not guaranteed. Furthermore,
adaptions of Smatch for extended tasks (e.g., fine-grained semantic similarity)
are spread out, and lack a unifying framework.
  For better inspection, we divide the metric into three modules:
pre-processing, alignment, and scoring. Examining each module, we specify its
goals and diagnose potential issues, for which we discuss and test mitigation
strategies. For pre-processing, we show how to fully conform to annotation
guidelines that allow structurally deviating but valid graphs. For safer and
enhanced alignment, we show the feasibility of optimal alignment in a standard

Improving Link Prediction in Social Networks Using Local and Global Features: A Clustering-based Approach,0.185646,"Link prediction problem has increasingly become prominent in many domains

based approaches which study a set of features to extract similar nodes; 2)
learning based approaches which extract patterns from the input data; 3)
probabilistic statistical approaches which optimize a set of parameters to
establish a model which can best compute formation probability. However,
existing literatures lack approaches which utilize strength of each approach by
integrating them to achieve a much more productive one. To tackle the link

categories. Our two-phase developed method firstly determines new features
related to the position and dynamic behavior of nodes, which enforce the
approach more efficiency compared to approaches using mere measures. Then, a

computed similarity measures which differentiate the strength of clusters;
basically, the usage of local and global indices and the clustering information

perspectives: encoding and decoding. From the encoding side, we perform
structured encoding on the adjacency matrix followed by the matrix-tree
learning algorithm, where all discourse links and relations in the dialogue are
jointly optimized based on latent tree-level distribution. From the decoding
side, we perform structured inference using the modified Chiu-Liu-Edmonds

Empowering Wildlife Guardians: An Equitable Digital Stewardship and Reward System for Biodiversity Conservation using Deep Learning and 3/4G Camera Traps,0.744144,"The biodiversity of our planet is under threat, with approximately one

Predicting Privacy Preferences for Smart Devices as Norms,0.463227,"Smart devices, such as smart speakers, are becoming ubiquitous, and users
expect these devices to act in accordance with their preferences. In
particular, since these devices gather and manage personal data, users expect
them to adhere to their privacy preferences. However, the current approach of
gathering these preferences consists in asking the users directly, which
usually triggers automatic responses failing to capture their true preferences.
In response, in this paper we present a collaborative filtering approach to
predict user preferences as norms. These preference predictions can be readily
adopted or can serve to assist users in determining their own preferences.
Using a dataset of privacy preferences of smart assistant users, we test the
accuracy of our predictions.",None,-1
MSdocTr-Lite: A Lite Transformer for Full Page Multi-script Handwriting Recognition,0.510608,"The Transformer has quickly become the dominant architecture for various
pattern recognition tasks due to its capacity for long-range representation.
However, transformers are data-hungry models and need large datasets for
training. In Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), collecting a massive amount of
labeled data is a complicated and expensive task. In this paper, we propose a
lite transformer architecture for full-page multi-script handwriting
recognition. The proposed model comes with three advantages: First, to solve
the common problem of data scarcity, we propose a lite transformer model that
can be trained on a reasonable amount of data, which is the case of most HTR
public datasets, without the need for external data. Second, it can learn the
reading order at page-level thanks to a curriculum learning strategy, allowing
it to avoid line segmentation errors, exploit a larger context and reduce the
need for costly segmentation annotations. Third, it can be easily adapted to
other scripts by applying a simple transfer-learning process using only
page-level labeled images. Extensive experiments on different datasets with
different scripts (French, English, Spanish, and Arabic) show the effectiveness
of the proposed model.",None,-1
DRM-IR: Task-Adaptive Deep Unfolding Network for All-In-One Image Restoration,0.148624,"Existing All-In-One image restoration (IR) methods usually lack flexible
modeling on various types of degradation, thus impeding the restoration
performance. To achieve All-In-One IR with higher task dexterity, this work
proposes an efficient Dynamic Reference Modeling paradigm (DRM-IR), which
consists of task-adaptive degradation modeling and model-based image restoring.
Specifically, these two subtasks are formalized as a pair of entangled
reference-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) inferences, which are optimized
synchronously in an unfolding-based manner. With the two cascaded subtasks,
DRM-IR first dynamically models the task-specific degradation based on a
reference image pair and further restores the image with the collected
degradation statistics. Besides, to bridge the semantic gap between the
reference and target degraded images, we further devise a Degradation Prior
Transmitter (DPT) that restrains the instance-specific feature differences.
DRM-IR explicitly provides superior flexibility for All-in-One IR while being
interpretable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our DRM-IR achieves state-of-the-art in All-In-One IR.",None,-1

On the Robustness of Latent Diffusion Models,0.264196,"Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
generative tasks, such as image synthesis and image editing. However, the
robustness of latent diffusion models is not well studied. Previous works only
focus on the adversarial attacks against the encoder or the output image under
white-box settings, regardless of the denoising process. Therefore, in this
paper, we aim to analyze the robustness of latent diffusion models more
thoroughly. We first study the influence of the components inside latent
diffusion models on their white-box robustness. In addition to white-box
scenarios, we evaluate the black-box robustness of latent diffusion models via
transfer attacks, where we consider both prompt-transfer and model-transfer
settings and possible defense mechanisms. However, all these explorations need
a comprehensive benchmark dataset, which is missing in the literature.
Therefore, to facilitate the research of the robustness of latent diffusion

arbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. By leveraging the
existing well-trained highly-performing encoders and decoders, NExT-GPT is

Attention Alignment and Flexible Positional Embeddings Improve Transformer Length Extrapolation,0.0564116,"An ideal length-extrapolatable Transformer language model can handle

Our findings show improvement on the long-context utilization capability of T5

Avalon's Game of Thoughts: Battle Against Deception through Recursive Contemplation,0.789349,"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
success in the field of LLM-as-Agent. Nevertheless, a prevalent assumption is
that the information processed by LLMs is consistently honest, neglecting the
pervasive deceptive or misleading information in human society and AI-generated
content. This oversight makes LLMs susceptible to malicious manipulations,
potentially resulting in detrimental outcomes. This study utilizes the
intricate Avalon game as a testbed to explore LLMs' potential in deceptive
environments. Avalon, full of misinformation and requiring sophisticated logic,
manifests as a ""Game-of-Thoughts"". Inspired by the efficacy of humans'
recursive thinking and perspective-taking in the Avalon game, we introduce a
novel framework, Recursive Contemplation (ReCon), to enhance LLMs' ability to
identify and counteract deceptive information. ReCon combines formulation and
refinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial
thoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them.
Additionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective
transitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order
allows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order
involves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After
integrating ReCon with different LLMs, extensive experiment results from the
Avalon game indicate its efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around
deceptive information without extra fine-tuning and data. Finally, we offer a
possible explanation for the efficacy of ReCon and explore the current
limitations of LLMs in terms of safety, reasoning, speaking style, and format,

text2shape deep retrieval model is established in order to support text
description-based mechanical part shapes retrieval, where the texts are for
describing the structural features of the target mechanical parts. More

Impact of Visual Context on Noisy Multimodal NMT: An Empirical Study for English to Indian Languages,0.250751,"The study investigates the effectiveness of utilizing multimodal information

Towards Generative Modeling of Urban Flow through Knowledge-enhanced Denoising Diffusion,0.846209,"Although generative AI has been successful in many areas, its ability to

Anytime Approximate Formal Feature Attribution,0.631019,"Widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine
learning (ML) models on the one hand and a number of crucial issues pertaining
to them warrant the need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). A key
explainability question is: given this decision was made, what are the input
features which contributed to the decision? Although a range of XAI approaches
exist to tackle this problem, most of them have significant limitations.
Heuristic XAI approaches suffer from the lack of quality guarantees, and often
try to approximate Shapley values, which is not the same as explaining which
features contribute to a decision. A recent alternative is so-called formal
feature attribution (FFA), which defines feature importance as the fraction of
formal abductive explanations (AXp's) containing the given feature. This
measures feature importance from the view of formally reasoning about the
model's behavior. It is challenging to compute FFA using its definition because
that involves counting AXp's, although one can approximate it. Based on these
results, this paper makes several contributions. First, it gives compelling
evidence that computing FFA is intractable, even if the set of contrastive
formal explanations (CXp's) is provided, by proving that the problem is
#P-hard. Second, by using the duality between AXp's and CXp's, it proposes an
efficient heuristic to switch from CXp enumeration to AXp enumeration
on-the-fly resulting in an adaptive explanation enumeration algorithm

On Modeling Network Slicing Communication Resources with SARSA Optimization,0.318434,"Network slicing is a crucial enabler to support the composition and
deployment of virtual network infrastructures required by the dynamic behavior
of networks like 5G/6G mobile networks, IoT-aware networks, e-health systems,

The communication slices and their allocated communication resources are
essential in slicing architectures for resource orchestration and allocation,
virtual network function (VNF) deployment, and slice operation functionalities.
The communication slices provide the communications capabilities required to
support slice operation, SLA guarantees, and QoS/ QoE application requirements.
Therefore, this contribution proposes a networking slicing conceptual model to

Generalized Universal Domain Adaptation with Generative Flow Networks,0.483344,"We introduce a new problem in unsupervised domain adaptation, termed as
Generalized Universal Domain Adaptation (GUDA), which aims to achieve precise
prediction of all target labels including unknown categories. GUDA bridges the
gap between label distribution shift-based and label space mismatch-based
variants, essentially categorizing them as a unified problem, guiding to a
comprehensive framework for thoroughly solving all the variants. The key
challenge of GUDA is developing and identifying novel target categories while
estimating the target label distribution. To address this problem, we take
advantage of the powerful exploration capability of generative flow networks
and propose an active domain adaptation algorithm named GFlowDA, which selects
diverse samples with probabilities proportional to a reward function. To
enhance the exploration capability and effectively perceive the target label
distribution, we tailor the states and rewards, and introduce an efficient
solution for parent exploration and state transition. We also propose a
training paradigm for GUDA called Generalized Universal Adversarial Network
(GUAN), which involves collaborative optimization between GUAN and GFlowNet.
Theoretical analysis highlights the importance of exploration, and extensive

SE-ORNet: Self-Ensembling Orientation-aware Network for Unsupervised Point Cloud Shape Correspondence,0.662247,"Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to obtain dense
point-to-point correspondences between point clouds without manually annotated
pairs. However, humans and some animals have bilateral symmetry and various
orientations, which lead to severe mispredictions of symmetrical parts.
Besides, point cloud noise disrupts consistent representations for point cloud
and thus degrades the shape correspondence accuracy. To address the above
issues, we propose a Self-Ensembling ORientation-aware Network termed SE-ORNet.
The key of our approach is to exploit an orientation estimation module with a
domain adaptive discriminator to align the orientations of point cloud pairs,
which significantly alleviates the mispredictions of symmetrical parts.
Additionally, we design a selfensembling framework for unsupervised point cloud
shape correspondence. In this framework, the disturbances of point cloud noise
are overcome by perturbing the inputs of the student and teacher networks with
different data augmentations and constraining the consistency of predictions.

UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models,0.362869,"Backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can be transferred

most existing backdoor attacks against PLMs are un-targeted and task-specific.
Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and
output representations, which prevent the attacks from being more effective and
general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more
threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new
backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous
approach by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically,
we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically
learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for
various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger
words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments

Prompt- and Trait Relation-aware Cross-prompt Essay Trait Scoring,0.775477,"Automated essay scoring (AES) aims to score essays written for a given
prompt, which defines the writing topic. Most existing AES systems assume to
grade essays of the same prompt as used in training and assign only a holistic

pre-graded essays for a particular prompt are lacking, and detailed trait
scores of sub-rubrics are required. Thus, predicting various trait scores of
unseen-prompt essays (called cross-prompt essay trait scoring) is a remaining
challenge of AES. In this paper, we propose a robust model: prompt- and trait
relation-aware cross-prompt essay trait scorer. We encode prompt-aware essay
representation by essay-prompt attention and utilizing the topic-coherence
feature extracted by the topic-modeling mechanism without access to labeled

a cross-prompt setting. To facilitate multi-trait scoring, we design

Effective Real Image Editing with Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion,0.737315,"Despite all recent progress, it is still challenging to edit and manipulate
natural images with modern generative models. When using Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), one major hurdle is in the inversion process mapping a real
image to its corresponding noise vector in the latent space, since its
necessary to be able to reconstruct an image to edit its contents. Likewise for
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), the linearization assumption in
each inversion step makes the whole deterministic inversion process unreliable.
Existing approaches that have tackled the problem of inversion stability often
incur in significant trade-offs in computational efficiency. In this work we
propose an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion method, dubbed AIDI, that
significantly improves reconstruction accuracy with minimal additional overhead
in space and time complexity. By using a novel blended guidance technique, we
show that effective results can be obtained on a large range of image editing

Scale-Equivariant UNet for Histopathology Image Segmentation,0.451235,"Digital histopathology slides are scanned and viewed under different
magnifications and stored as images at different resolutions. Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on such images at a given scale fail to
generalise to those at different scales. This inability is often addressed by
augmenting training data with re-scaled images, allowing a model with
sufficient capacity to learn the requisite patterns. Alternatively, designing
CNN filters to be scale-equivariant frees up model capacity to learn
discriminative features. In this paper, we propose the Scale-Equivariant UNet
(SEUNet) for image segmentation by building on scale-space theory. The SEUNet
contains groups of filters that are linear combinations of Gaussian basis
filters, whose scale parameters are trainable but constrained to span disjoint

our method outperforms other approaches, with much fewer trainable parameters.",None,-1
The Undesirable Dependence on Frequency of Gender Bias Metrics Based on Word Embeddings,0.5704,"Numerous works use word embedding-based metrics to quantify societal biases
and stereotypes in texts. Recent studies have found that word embeddings can
capture semantic similarity but may be affected by word frequency. In this work
we study the effect of frequency when measuring female vs. male gender bias
with word embedding-based bias quantification methods. We find that Skip-gram
with negative sampling and GloVe tend to detect male bias in high frequency
words, while GloVe tends to return female bias in low frequency words. We show
these behaviors still exist when words are randomly shuffled. This proves that
the frequency-based effect observed in unshuffled corpora stems from properties
of the metric rather than from word associations. The effect is spurious and
problematic since bias metrics should depend exclusively on word co-occurrences
and not individual word frequencies. Finally, we compare these results with the
ones obtained with an alternative metric based on Pointwise Mutual Information.
We find that this metric does not show a clear dependence on frequency, even
though it is slightly skewed towards male bias across all frequencies.",None,-1
Zero-shot Visual Question Answering with Language Model Feedback,0.236799,"In this paper, we propose a novel language model guided captioning approach,

major contribution, we leverage the guidance and feedback of the prediction
model to improve the capability of the captioning model. In this way, the
captioning model can become aware of the task goal and information need from
the PLM. To develop our approach, we design two specific training stages, where
the first stage adapts the captioning model to the prediction model (selecting
more suitable caption propositions for training) and the second stage tunes the
captioning model according to the task goal (learning from feedback of the
PLM). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach on the knowledge-based VQA task. Specifically, on the challenging

Learning Logic Specifications for Soft Policy Guidance in POMCP,0.851188,"Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is an efficient solver for
Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It allows scaling to
large state spaces by computing an approximation of the optimal policy locally

suffers from sparse reward function, namely, rewards achieved only when the
final goal is reached, particularly in environments with large state spaces and
long horizons. Recently, logic specifications have been integrated into POMCP

policy-related rules require manual definition by domain experts, especially in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we use inductive logic programming to
learn logic specifications from traces of POMCP executions, i.e., sets of
belief-action pairs generated by the planner. Specifically, we learn rules
expressed in the paradigm of answer set programming. We then integrate them
inside POMCP to provide soft policy bias toward promising actions. In the
context of two benchmark scenarios, rocksample and battery, we show that the

Active Neural Mapping,0.582136,"We address the problem of active mapping with a continually-learned neural
scene representation, namely Active Neural Mapping. The key lies in actively
finding the target space to be explored with efficient agent movement, thus
minimizing the map uncertainty on-the-fly within a previously unseen

continually-learned neural field, and show empirically that the neural
variability, the prediction robustness against random weight perturbation, can
be directly utilized to measure the instant uncertainty of the neural map.
Together with the continuous geometric information inherited in the neural map,
the agent can be guided to find a traversable path to gradually gain knowledge
of the environment. We present for the first time an active mapping system with
a coordinate-based implicit neural representation for online scene

ESCL: Equivariant Self-Contrastive Learning for Sentence Representations,0.0545415,"Previous contrastive learning methods for sentence representations often

representations to be sensitive to certain types of transformations with an
additional equivariant learning task. Meanwhile, in order to improve
practicability and generality, ESCL simplifies the implementations of
traditional equivariant contrastive methods to share model parameters from the

CVRecon: Rethinking 3D Geometric Feature Learning For Neural Reconstruction,0.656728,"Recent advances in neural reconstruction using posed image sequences have
made remarkable progress. However, due to the lack of depth information,
existing volumetric-based techniques simply duplicate 2D image features of the
object surface along the entire camera ray. We contend this duplication
introduces noise in empty and occluded spaces, posing challenges for producing
high-quality 3D geometry. Drawing inspiration from traditional multi-view
stereo methods, we propose an end-to-end 3D neural reconstruction framework
CVRecon, designed to exploit the rich geometric embedding in the cost volumes
to facilitate 3D geometric feature learning. Furthermore, we present
Ray-contextual Compensated Cost Volume (RCCV), a novel 3D geometric feature

INSTRUCTSCORE: Explainable Text Generation Evaluation with Finegrained Feedback,0.221501,"Automatically evaluating the quality of language generation is critical.
Although recent learned metrics show high correlation with human judgement,

InstructScore on a variety of generation tasks, including translation,

Preference-conditioned Pixel-based AI Agent For Game Testing,0.544551,"The game industry is challenged to cope with increasing growth in demand and
game complexity while maintaining acceptable quality standards for released
games. Classic approaches solely depending on human efforts for quality
assurance and game testing do not scale effectively in terms of time and cost.
Game-testing AI agents that learn by interaction with the environment have the
potential to mitigate these challenges with good scalability properties on time
and costs. However, most recent work in this direction depends on game state
information for the agent's state representation, which limits generalization
across different game scenarios. Moreover, game test engineers usually prefer
exploring a game in a specific style, such as exploring the golden path.
However, current game testing AI agents do not provide an explicit way to
satisfy such a preference. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing
an agent design that mainly depends on pixel-based state observations while
exploring the environment conditioned on a user's preference specified by
demonstration trajectories. In addition, we propose an imitation learning
method that couples self-supervised and supervised learning objectives to
enhance the quality of imitation behaviors. Our agent significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art pixel-based game testing agents over exploration coverage and
test execution quality when evaluated on a complex open-world environment

An interpretability framework for Similar case matching,0.101782,"Similar Case Matching (SCM) plays a pivotal role in the legal system by
facilitating the efficient identification of similar cases for legal

framework for interpretable SCM. The framework comprises four modules: judicial
feature sentence identification, case matching, feature sentence alignment, and
conflict resolution. In contrast to current SCM methods, our framework first
extracts feature sentences within a legal case that contain essential
information. Then it conducts case matching based on these extracted features.
Subsequently, our framework aligns the corresponding sentences in two legal
cases to provide evidence of similarity. In instances where the results of case
matching and feature sentence alignment exhibit conflicts, the conflict
resolution module resolves these inconsistencies. The experimental results show
the effectiveness of our proposed framework, establishing a new benchmark for
interpretable SCM.",None,-1
Guideline Learning for In-context Information Extraction,0.665379,"Large language models (LLMs) can perform a new task by merely conditioning on
task instructions and a few input-output examples, without optimizing any

Extraction (IE) has recently garnered attention in the research community.
However, the performance of In-context IE generally lags behind the
state-of-the-art supervised expert models. We highlight a key reason for this
shortfall: underspecified task description. The limited-length context
struggles to thoroughly express the intricate IE task instructions and various
edge cases, leading to misalignment in task comprehension with humans. In this
paper, we propose a Guideline Learning (GL) framework for In-context IE which
reflectively learns and follows guidelines. During the learning phrase, GL
automatically synthesizes a set of guidelines based on a few error cases, and
during inference, GL retrieves helpful guidelines for better ICL. Moreover, we
propose a self-consistency-based active learning method to enhance the

An Efficient Approximate Method for Online Convolutional Dictionary Learning,0.0655538,"Most existing convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) algorithms are based on
batch learning, where the dictionary filters and the convolutional sparse

the memory requirements of CDL by optimizing the dictionary incrementally after
finding the sparse representations of each training sample. Nevertheless,
learning large dictionaries using the existing online CDL (OCDL) algorithms

approximate OCDL method that incorporates sparse decomposition of the training

Controllable Path of Destruction,0.0505502,"Path of Destruction (PoD) is a self-supervised method for learning iterative

generate new artifacts by repairing from arbitrary states. The PoD method is
very data-efficient in terms of original training examples and well-suited to
functional artifacts composed of categorical data, such as game levels and
discrete 3D structures. In this paper, we extend the Path of Destruction method
to allow designer control over aspects of the generated artifacts.
Controllability is introduced by adding conditional inputs to the state-action

Concept2Box: Joint Geometric Embeddings for Learning Two-View Knowledge Graphs,0.710906,"Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been extensively studied to embed
large-scale relational data for many real-world applications. Existing methods

usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single
geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between
two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We
propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG
using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings,
which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and
disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity.
Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap

performs in an end-to-end manner via general graph parsing: (1) instead of flat
sequence labelling, nested structures between entities/triggers are efficiently
encoded as separate nodes in the graph, allowing for nested and overlapping
entities and triggers; (2) both entities, relations, and events can be encoded
in the same graph, where entities and event triggers are represented as nodes
and entity relations and event arguments are constructed via edges; (3) joint
inference avoids error propagation and enhances the interpolation of different
IE tasks. We experiment on two benchmark datasets of varying structural
complexities; ACE05 and Rich ERE, covering three languages: English, Chinese,

Exploring Effective Mask Sampling Modeling for Neural Image Compression,0.451188,"Image compression aims to reduce the information redundancy in images. Most

Traveling Words: A Geometric Interpretation of Transformers,0.122851,"Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language
processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the
inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is
illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a
hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic
representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly
connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual
embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter
GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early
layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature
of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we
present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes
that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.",None,-1
arXiv4TGC: Large-Scale Datasets for Temporal Graph Clustering,0.330936,"Temporal graph clustering (TGC) is a crucial task in temporal graph learning.
Its focus is on node clustering on temporal graphs, and it offers greater
flexibility for large-scale graph structures due to the mechanism of temporal
graph methods. However, the development of TGC is currently constrained by a
significant problem: the lack of suitable and reliable large-scale temporal
graph datasets to evaluate clustering performance. In other words, most
existing temporal graph datasets are in small sizes, and even large-scale
datasets contain only a limited number of available node labels. It makes
evaluating models for large-scale temporal graph clustering challenging. To
address this challenge, we build arXiv4TGC, a set of novel academic datasets
(including arXivAI, arXivCS, arXivMath, arXivPhy, and arXivLarge) for
large-scale temporal graph clustering. In particular, the largest dataset,
arXivLarge, contains 1.3 million labeled available nodes and 10 million
temporal edges. We further compare the clustering performance with typical
temporal graph learning models on both previous classic temporal graph datasets
and the new datasets proposed in this paper. The clustering performance on
arXiv4TGC can be more apparent for evaluating different models, resulting in
higher clustering confidence and more suitable for large-scale temporal graph
clustering. The arXiv4TGC datasets are publicly available at:

Efficient Parametric Approximations of Neural Network Function Space Distance,0.314159,"It is often useful to compactly summarize important properties of model
parameters and training data so that they can be used later without storing
and/or iterating over the entire dataset. As a specific case, we consider
estimating the Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the
average discrepancy between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a
Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient
approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate
the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring
only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other
parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual
learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art
nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples.
Furthermore, we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately

distractibility of cutting-edge prompting techniques for large language models,

information.",None,-1
An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the multi-port continuous berth allocation problem,0.0772219,"In this paper, we study a problem that integrates the vessel scheduling

the berth allocation of a set of ships simultaneously in multiple ports while
also considering the sailing speed of ships between ports. Due to the highly

Parallelizing Optical Flow Estimation on an Ultra-Low Power RISC-V Cluster for Nano-UAV Navigation,0.150126,"Optical flow estimation is crucial for autonomous navigation and localization

Point2Vec for Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Point Clouds,0.554849,"Recently, the self-supervised learning framework data2vec has shown inspiring
performance for various modalities using a masked student-teacher approach.
However, it remains open whether such a framework generalizes to the unique

Deceptive Reinforcement Learning in Model-Free Domains,0.0852194,"This paper investigates deceptive reinforcement learning for privacy
preservation in model-free and continuous action space domains. In
reinforcement learning, the reward function defines the agent's objective. In

model-free domains due to misdirected state space exploration. It is also
inefficient to train and inapplicable in continuous action space domains. We
propose the deceptive exploration ambiguity model (DEAM), which learns using
the deceptive policy during training, leading to targeted exploration of the

continuously affect model optimization. To this end, we propose a novel
framework for noisy PLL with theoretical guarantees, called ``Adjusting Label
Importance Mechanism (ALIM)''. It aims to reduce the negative impact of
detection errors by trading off the initial candidate set and model outputs.
ALIM is a plug-in strategy that can be integrated with existing PLL approaches.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on noisy PLL.

Roll-Drop: accounting for observation noise with a single parameter,0.138803,"This paper proposes a simple strategy for sim-to-real in Deep-Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) -- called Roll-Drop -- that uses dropout during simulation to
account for observation noise during deployment without explicitly modelling
its distribution for each state. DRL is a promising approach to control robots
for highly dynamic and feedback-based manoeuvres, and accurate simulators are
crucial to providing cheap and abundant data to learn the desired behaviour.
Nevertheless, the simulated data are noiseless and generally show a
distributional shift that challenges the deployment on real machines where
sensor readings are affected by noise. The standard solution is modelling the
latter and injecting it during training; while this requires a thorough system
identification, Roll-Drop enhances the robustness to sensor noise by tuning
only a single parameter. We demonstrate an 80% success rate when up to 25%
noise is injected in the observations, with twice higher robustness than the
baselines. We deploy the controller trained in simulation on a Unitree A1

ArCL: Enhancing Contrastive Learning with Augmentation-Robust Representations,0.374525,"Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a paradigm that leverages unlabeled data

transferability remains limited. In this paper, we develop a theoretical
framework to analyze the transferability of self-supervised contrastive
learning, by investigating the impact of data augmentation on it. Our results
reveal that the downstream performance of contrastive learning depends largely
on the choice of data augmentation. Moreover, we show that contrastive learning
fails to learn domain-invariant features, which limits its transferability.
Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel method called
Augmentation-robust Contrastive Learning (ArCL), which guarantees to learn
domain-invariant features and can be easily integrated with existing
contrastive learning algorithms. We conduct experiments on several datasets and

applications, including speaker recognition and paralinguistic analysis. We
provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic
descriptors involving: frequency-related parameters, energy or
amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal
features. Unlike prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a
few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP)
loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grain speech
characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an
auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved
perceptual quality and intelligibility. We use data from the Deep Noise

Context-Aware Change Detection With Semi-Supervised Learning,0.0996934,"Change detection using earth observation data plays a vital role in
quantifying the impact of disasters in affected areas. While data sources like

Understanding and Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Text Classification with Neighborhood Analysis,0.0595305,"Recent research has revealed that machine learning models have a tendency to
leverage spurious correlations that exist in the training set but may not hold
true in general circumstances. For instance, a sentiment classifier may
erroneously learn that the token ""performances"" is commonly associated with
positive movie reviews. Relying on these spurious correlations degrades the
classifiers performance when it deploys on out-of-distribution data. In this
paper, we examine the implications of spurious correlations through a novel
perspective called neighborhood analysis. The analysis uncovers how spurious
correlations lead unrelated words to erroneously cluster together in the
embedding space. Driven by the analysis, we design a metric to detect spurious

malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's

to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model
aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the
aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the
aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the
verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a
zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and

DPPD: Deformable Polar Polygon Object Detection,0.039385,"Regular object detection methods output rectangle bounding boxes, which are
unable to accurately describe the actual object shapes. Instance segmentation

vertex is represented by a pair of angle and distance in the Polar coordinate
system. To enable training, both ground truth and predicted polygons are
densely resampled to have the same number of vertices with equal-spaced
raypoints. The resampling operation is fully differentable, allowing gradient
back-propagation. Sparse polygon predicton ensures high-speed runtime inference
while dense resampling allows the network to learn object shapes with high

Generative Plug and Play: Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems,0.747906,"Over the past decade, Plug-and-Play (PnP) has become a popular method for
reconstructing images using a modular framework consisting of a forward and
prior model. The great strength of PnP is that an image denoiser can be used as
a prior model while the forward model can be implemented using more traditional
physics-based approaches. However, a limitation of PnP is that it reconstructs
only a single deterministic image.
  In this paper, we introduce Generative Plug-and-Play (GPnP), a generalization
of PnP to sample from the posterior distribution. As with PnP, GPnP has a
modular framework using a physics-based forward model and an image denoising

unexpected bias appears to arise from distinct linguistic patterns inherent to
LLM outputs. To address this, we introduce a mitigation strategy that leverages
adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news. The resulting model

spatial and structural cues from these patch-based line segments, simplifying
the process of constructing the road network graph without the necessity of
additional neural networks for connectivity. In our experiments, we demonstrate

HeightFormer: Explicit Height Modeling without Extra Data for Camera-only 3D Object Detection in Bird's Eye View,0.514041,"Vision-based Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is an emerging perception
formulation for autonomous driving. The core challenge is to construct BEV
space with multi-camera features, which is a one-to-many ill-posed problem.
Diving into all previous BEV representation generation methods, we found that
most of them fall into two types: modeling depths in image views or modeling
heights in the BEV space, mostly in an implicit way. In this work, we propose
to explicitly model heights in the BEV space, which needs no extra data like
LiDAR and can fit arbitrary camera rigs and types compared to modeling depths.
Theoretically, we give proof of the equivalence between height-based methods
and depth-based methods. Considering the equivalence and some advantages of
modeling heights, we propose HeightFormer, which models heights and
uncertainties in a self-recursive way. Without any extra data, the proposed
HeightFormer could estimate heights in BEV accurately. Benchmark results show
that the performance of HeightFormer achieves SOTA compared with those
camera-only methods.",None,-1
Manipulating Embeddings of Stable Diffusion Prompts,0.037178,"Prompt engineering is still the primary way for users of generative
text-to-image models to manipulate generated images in a targeted way. Based on
treating the model as a continuous function and by passing gradients between
the image space and the prompt embedding space, we propose and analyze a new
method to directly manipulate the embedding of a prompt instead of the prompt
text. We then derive three practical interaction tools to support users with
image generation: (1) Optimization of a metric defined in the image space that
measures, for example, the image style. (2) Supporting a user in creative tasks
by allowing them to navigate in the image space along a selection of directions
of ""near"" prompt embeddings. (3) Changing the embedding of the prompt to
include information that a user has seen in a particular seed but has
difficulty describing in the prompt. Compared to prompt engineering,
user-driven prompt embedding manipulation enables a more fine-grained, targeted
control that integrates a user's intentions. Our user study shows that our
methods are considered less tedious and that the resulting images are often
preferred.",None,-1
The Co-12 Recipe for Evaluating Interpretable Part-Prototype Image Classifiers,0.698124,"Interpretable part-prototype models are computer vision models that are

Simplified Continuous High Dimensional Belief Space Planning with Adaptive Probabilistic Belief-dependent Constraints,0.346499,"Online decision making under uncertainty in partially observable domains,
also known as Belief Space Planning, is a fundamental problem in robotics and
Artificial Intelligence. Due to an abundance of plausible future unravelings,
calculating an optimal course of action inflicts an enormous computational
burden on the agent. Moreover, in many scenarios, e.g., information gathering,
it is required to introduce a belief-dependent constraint. Prompted by this
demand, in this paper, we consider a recently introduced probabilistic
belief-dependent constrained POMDP. We present a technique to adaptively accept
or discard a candidate action sequence with respect to a probabilistic
belief-dependent constraint, before expanding a complete set of future
observations samples and without any loss in accuracy. Moreover, using our
proposed framework, we contribute an adaptive method to find a maximal feasible
return (e.g., information gain) in terms of Value at Risk for the candidate
action sequence with substantial acceleration. On top of that, we introduce an
adaptive simplification technique for a probabilistically constrained setting.
Such an approach provably returns an identical-quality solution while
dramatically accelerating online decision making. Our universal framework
applies to any belief-dependent constrained continuous POMDP with parametric
beliefs, as well as nonparametric beliefs represented by particles. In the
context of an information-theoretic constraint, our presented framework
stochastically quantifies if a cumulative information gain along the planning
horizon is sufficiently significant (e.g. for, information gathering, active
SLAM). We apply our method to active SLAM, a highly challenging problem of high

the superiority of our proposed ideas.",None,-1
Deep Image Harmonization in Dual Color Spaces,0.695278,"Image harmonization is an essential step in image composition that adjusts
the appearance of composite foreground to address the inconsistency between

channels that provide disentangled color and illumination statistics. In this
paper, we explore image harmonization in dual color spaces, which supplements
entangled $RGB$ features with disentangled $L$, $a$, $b$ features to alleviate
the workload in harmonization process. The network comprises a $RGB$
harmonization backbone, an $Lab$ encoding module, and an $Lab$ control module.
The backbone is a U-Net network translating composite image to harmonized

Revisiting Deformable Convolution for Depth Completion,0.108424,"Depth completion, which aims to generate high-quality dense depth maps from
sparse depth maps, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Previous
work usually employs RGB images as guidance, and introduces iterative spatial

fixed receptive field, which may contain irrelevant and useless information
with very sparse input. In this paper, we address these two challenges
simultaneously by revisiting the idea of deformable convolution. We propose an
effective architecture that leverages deformable kernel convolution as a
single-pass refinement module, and empirically demonstrate its superiority. To
better understand the function of deformable convolution and exploit it for
depth completion, we further systematically investigate a variety of
representative strategies. Our study reveals that, different from prior work,

Implicit Neural Head Synthesis via Controllable Local Deformation Fields,0.524946,"High-quality reconstruction of controllable 3D head avatars from 2D videos is

Analysis over vision-based models for pedestrian action anticipation,0.527633,"Anticipating human actions in front of autonomous vehicles is a challenging
task. Several papers have recently proposed model architectures to address this

architectures that utilize standard CNN and Transformer modules to serve as a
backbone for pedestrian anticipation. However, the objective of this paper is
not to surpass state-of-the-art benchmarks but rather to analyze the positive

explainability of vision-based Transformer models in the context of pedestrian

Approximate spectral clustering with eigenvector selection and self-tuned $k$,0.184638,"The recently emerged spectral clustering surpasses conventional clustering
methods by detecting clusters of any shape without the convexity assumption.
Unfortunately, with a computational complexity of $O(n^3)$, it was infeasible
for multiple real applications, where $n$ could be large. This stimulates
researchers to propose the approximate spectral clustering (ASC). However, most
of ASC methods assumed that the number of clusters $k$ was known. In practice,
manual setting of $k$ could be subjective or time consuming. The proposed
algorithm has two relevance metrics for estimating $k$ in two vital steps of
ASC. One for selecting the eigenvectors spanning the embedding space, and the
other to discover the number of clusters in that space. The algorithm used a
growing neural gas (GNG) approximation, GNG is superior in preserving input

Trajectory-User Linking via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks,0.182059,"Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) is crucial for human mobility modeling by

denoising pure Gaussian noise images. While previous research has primarily
focused on improving the control of image generation through adjusting the

we show that blocks of pixels in the initial latent images have a preference

significantly influence the generated image. In particular, we show that
modifying a part of the initial image affects the corresponding region of the
generated image while leaving other regions unaffected, which is useful for
repainting tasks. Furthermore, we find that the generation preferences of pixel
blocks are primarily determined by their values, rather than their position. By
moving pixel blocks with a tendency to generate user-desired content to

RICO: Regularizing the Unobservable for Indoor Compositional Reconstruction,0.676627,"Recently, neural implicit surfaces have become popular for multi-view
reconstruction. To facilitate practical applications like scene editing and

Though achieving plausible disentanglement, the performance drops significantly
when processing the indoor scenes where objects are usually partially observed.
We propose RICO to address this by regularizing the unobservable regions for
indoor compositional reconstruction. Our key idea is to first regularize the
smoothness of the occluded background, which then in turn guides the foreground
object reconstruction in unobservable regions based on the object-background
relationship. Particularly, we regularize the geometry smoothness of occluded
background patches. With the improved background surface, the signed distance
function and the reversedly rendered depth of objects can be optimized to bound
them within the background range. Extensive experiments show our method
outperforms other methods on synthetic and real-world indoor scenes and prove

Cracking the Code of Negative Transfer: A Cooperative Game Theoretic Approach for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation,0.521157,"This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a
promising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three)

sequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems

dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous
knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to
differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a
new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing
the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively
assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this
end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal
contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game
theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that
incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that
of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive
learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially

AdaMixBN module and a Generalized Entropy Minimization (GEM) loss.
Specifically, AdaMixBN addresses the domain shift by adaptively fusing training

A Theory of Emergent In-Context Learning as Implicit Structure Induction,0.301364,"Scaling large language models (LLMs) leads to an emergent capacity to learn
in-context from example demonstrations. Despite progress, theoretical
understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. We argue that in-context
learning relies on recombination of compositional operations found in natural

learning abilities arise from generic next-token prediction when the
pretraining distribution has sufficient amounts of compositional structure,
under linguistically motivated assumptions. A second bound provides a
theoretical justification for the empirical success of prompting LLMs to output
intermediate steps towards an answer. To validate theoretical predictions, we
introduce a controlled setup for inducing in-context learning; unlike previous
approaches, it accounts for the compositional nature of language. Trained
transformers can perform in-context learning for a range of tasks, in a manner
consistent with the theoretical results. Mirroring real-world LLMs in a
miniature setup, in-context learning emerges when scaling parameters and data,

shows that in-context learning is supported by a representation of the input's
compositional structure. Taken together, these results provide a step towards

Enhancing Video Super-Resolution via Implicit Resampling-based Alignment,0.0789836,"In video super-resolution, it is common to use a frame-wise alignment to
support the propagation of information over time. The role of alignment is
well-studied for low-level enhancement in video, but existing works overlook a

alignment to be effective, the resampling should preserve the reference
frequency spectrum while minimizing spatial distortions. However, most existing
works simply use a default choice of bilinear interpolation for resampling even
though bilinear interpolation has a smoothing effect and hinders
super-resolution. From these observations, we propose an implicit
resampling-based alignment. The sampling positions are encoded by a sinusoidal
positional encoding, while the value is estimated with a coordinate network and
a window-based cross-attention. We show that bilinear interpolation inherently

Hence, usual methods assign labels for unannotated data with the prediction by
a well-trained source model in an unsupervised learning framework. Previous
studies have employed unsupervised objectives, such as the entropy of model
predictions, as optimization targets to effectively learn features for
test-time samples. However, the performance of the model is easily compromised
by the quality of pseudo-labels, since inaccuracies in pseudo-labels introduce
noise to the model. Therefore, we propose to leverage the ""less probable

Does Federated Learning Really Need Backpropagation?,0.510565,"Federated learning (FL) is a general principle for decentralized clients to

backpropagation on them incurs computational and storage overhead as well as
white-box vulnerability. In light of this, we develop backpropagation-free

multiple forward processes to estimate gradients. BAFFLE is 1) memory-efficient

demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on
coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to
investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice
from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a
voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies
predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face
reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face
geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face
geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with
ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find
significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry,
such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on
voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for
anthropometry science.",None,-1
AU-aware graph convolutional network for Macro- and Micro-expression spotting,0.766672,"Automatic Micro-Expression (ME) spotting in long videos is a crucial step in
ME analysis but also a challenging task due to the short duration and low

performance of ME spotting, this paper seeks to extract finer spatial features
by modeling the relationships between facial Regions of Interest (ROIs).
Specifically, we propose a graph convolutional-based network, called
Action-Unit-aWare Graph Convolutional Network (AUW-GCN). Furthermore, to inject
prior information and to cope with the problem of small datasets, AU-related
statistics are encoded into the network. Comprehensive experiments show that

Audio-Visual Class-Incremental Learning,0.999428,"In this paper, we introduce audio-visual class-incremental learning, a

that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as
incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity
Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic
similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation

Multi-view Self-supervised Disentanglement for General Image Denoising,0.431914,"With its significant performance improvements, the deep learning paradigm has
become a standard tool for modern image denoisers. While promising performance
has been shown on seen noise distributions, existing approaches often suffer
from generalisation to unseen noise types or general and real noise. It is
understandable as the model is designed to learn paired mapping (e.g. from a
noisy image to its clean version). In this paper, we instead propose to learn
to disentangle the noisy image, under the intuitive assumption that different
corrupted versions of the same clean image share a common latent space. A
self-supervised learning framework is proposed to achieve the goal, without
looking at the latent clean image. By taking two different corrupted versions
of the same image as input, the proposed Multi-view Self-supervised
Disentanglement (MeD) approach learns to disentangle the latent clean features
from the corruptions and recover the clean image consequently. Extensive

Scaling Sentence Embeddings with Large Language Models,0.982438,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant interest.
With in-context learning, LLMs achieve impressive results in various natural
language tasks. However, the application of LLMs to sentence embeddings remains
an area of ongoing research. In this work, we propose an in-context
learning-based method aimed at improving sentence embeddings performance. Our
approach involves adapting the previous prompt-based representation method for
autoregressive models, constructing a demonstration set that enables LLMs to
perform in-context learning, and scaling up the LLMs to different model sizes.
Through extensive experiments, in-context learning enables LLMs to generate
high-quality sentence embeddings without any fine-tuning. It helps LLMs achieve
performance comparable to current contrastive learning methods. By scaling
model size, we find scaling to more than tens of billion parameters harms the
performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, the largest

Graph Decision Transformer,0.495718,"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging task, whose objective is

approach that models the input sequence into a causal graph to capture
potential dependencies between fundamentally different concepts and facilitate
temporal and causal relationship learning. GDT uses a graph transformer to

Sentence Embedding Leaks More Information than You Expect: Generative Embedding Inversion Attack to Recover the Whole Sentence,0.777899,"Sentence-level representations are beneficial for various natural language

input sequences based only on their sentence embeddings. Given the black-box
access to a language model, we treat sentence embeddings as initial tokens'

Generating Faithful Synthetic Data with Large Language Models: A Case Study in Computational Social Science,0.986305,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have democratized synthetic data generation,

sarcasm detection, we study three strategies to increase the faithfulness of
synthetic data: grounding, filtering, and taxonomy-based generation. We
evaluate these strategies using the performance of classifiers trained with
generated synthetic data on real-world data. While all three strategies improve
the performance of classifiers, we find that grounding works best for the task

innovative agent that leverages GPT-4's capabilities for performing in
imperfect information games. With proper prompt engineering to achieve
different functions, Suspicion-Agent based on GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable
adaptability across a range of imperfect information card games. Importantly,
GPT-4 displays a strong high-order theory of mind (ToM) capacity, meaning it

Learning Optimal Policy for Simultaneous Machine Translation via Binary Search,0.699964,"Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts to output translation while

Trusted Source Alignment in Large Language Models,0.01269,"Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that inevitably
include contradictory factual information from sources of varying reliability.

trusted publishers in the face of uncertainty or controversy. We present
FactCheckQA, a TSA evaluation dataset based on a corpus of fact checking
articles. We describe a simple protocol for evaluating TSA and offer a detailed
analysis of design considerations including response extraction, claim

Revisiting Machine Translation for Cross-lingual Classification,0.917145,"Machine Translation (MT) has been widely used for cross-lingual
classification, either by translating the test set into English and running
inference with a monolingual model (translate-test), or translating the
training set into the target languages and finetuning a multilingual model
(translate-train). However, most research in the area focuses on the
multilingual models rather than the MT component. We show that, by using a
stronger MT system and mitigating the mismatch between training on original
text and running inference on machine translated text, translate-test can do
substantially better than previously assumed. The optimal approach, however, is
highly task dependent, as we identify various sources of cross-lingual transfer
gap that affect different tasks and approaches differently. Our work calls into
question the dominance of multilingual models for cross-lingual classification,

Applying HCAI in developing effective human-AI teaming: A perspective from human-AI joint cognitive systems,0.282023,"Research and application have used human-AI teaming (HAT) as a new paradigm
to develop AI systems. HAT recognizes that AI will function as a teammate
instead of simply a tool in collaboration with humans. Effective human-AI teams
need to be capable of taking advantage of the unique abilities of both humans
and AI while overcoming the known challenges and limitations of each member,
augmenting human capabilities, and raising joint performance beyond that of
either entity. The National AI Research and Strategic Plan 2023 update has
recognized that research programs focusing primarily on the independent
performance of AI systems generally fail to consider the functionality that AI
must provide within the context of dynamic, adaptive, and collaborative teams
and calls for further research on human-AI teaming and collaboration. However,
there has been debate about whether AI can work as a teammate with humans. The
primary concern is that adopting the ""teaming"" paradigm contradicts the
human-centered AI (HCAI) approach, resulting in humans losing control of AI
systems. This article further analyzes the HAT paradigm and the debates.
Specifically, we elaborate on our proposed conceptual framework of human-AI
joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) and apply it to represent HAT under the HCAI
umbrella. We believe that HAIJCS may help adopt HAI while enabling HCAI. The
implications and future work for HAIJCS are also discussed.
  Insights: AI has led to the emergence of a new form of human-machine
relationship: human-AI teaming (HAT), a paradigmatic shift in human-AI systems;
We must follow a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach when applying HAT as a new
design paradigm; We propose a conceptual framework of human-AI joint cognitive
systems (HAIJCS) to represent and implement HAT for developing effective

Focus on Your Target: A Dual Teacher-Student Framework for Domain-adaptive Semantic Segmentation,0.2125,"We study unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation.
Currently, a popular UDA framework lies in self-training which endows the model
with two-fold abilities: (i) learning reliable semantics from the labeled
images in the source domain, and (ii) adapting to the target domain via
generating pseudo labels on the unlabeled images. We find that, by
decreasing/increasing the proportion of training samples from the target
domain, the 'learning ability' is strengthened/weakened while the 'adapting
ability' goes in the opposite direction, implying a conflict between these two
abilities, especially for a single model. To alleviate the issue, we propose a
novel dual teacher-student (DTS) framework and equip it with a bidirectional
learning strategy. By increasing the proportion of target-domain data, the
second teacher-student model learns to 'Focus on Your Target' while the first
model is not affected. DTS is easily plugged into existing self-training
approaches. In a standard UDA scenario (training on synthetic, labeled data and
real, unlabeled data), DTS shows consistent gains over the baselines and sets

Cooperative Open-ended Learning Framework for Zero-shot Coordination,0.735513,"Zero-shot coordination in cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) remains a
significant challenge, which means effectively coordinating with a wide range

of learning and an inability to cooperate with certain strategies within the
population, known as cooperative incompatibility. To address this issue, we

open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players from the
perspective of graph theory to assess and identify the cooperative ability of
each strategy. We further specify the framework and propose a practical
algorithm that leverages knowledge from game theory and graph theory.

NEF: Neural Edge Fields for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction from Multi-view Images,0.896954,"We study the problem of reconstructing 3D feature curves of an object from a
set of calibrated multi-view images. To do so, we learn a neural implicit field

rendering loss where a 2D edge map is rendered at a given view and is compared
to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the image of that view. The
rendering-based differentiable optimization of NEF fully exploits 2D edge
detection, without needing a supervision of 3D edges, a 3D geometric operator

Does Manipulating Tokenization Aid Cross-Lingual Transfer? A Study on POS Tagging for Non-Standardized Languages,0.495302,"One of the challenges with finetuning pretrained language models (PLMs) is
that their tokenizer is optimized for the language(s) it was pretrained on, but
brittle when it comes to previously unseen variations in the data. This can for
instance be observed when finetuning PLMs on one language and evaluating them
on data in a closely related language variety with no standardized orthography.
Despite the high linguistic similarity, tokenization no longer corresponds to
meaningful representations of the target data, leading to low performance in,
e.g., part-of-speech tagging.
  In this work, we finetune PLMs on seven languages from three different
families and analyze their zero-shot performance on closely related,
non-standardized varieties. We consider different measures for the divergence
in the tokenization of the source and target data, and the way they can be
adjusted by manipulating the tokenization during the finetuning step. Overall,
we find that the similarity between the percentage of words that get split into
subwords in the source and target data (the split word ratio difference) is the
strongest predictor for model performance on target data.",None,-1

DiffS2UT: A Semantic Preserving Diffusion Model for Textless Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation,0.198201,"While Diffusion Generative Models have achieved great success on image
generation tasks, how to efficiently and effectively incorporate them into

Specifically, due to the low information density of speech data, the
transformed discrete speech unit sequence is much longer than the corresponding
text transcription, posing significant challenges to existing auto-regressive

the speech unit sequence while disregarding the continuous space structure,
which will degrade the generation performance significantly. In this paper, we
propose a novel diffusion model by applying the diffusion forward process in
the \textit{continuous} speech representation space, while employing the
diffusion backward process in the \textit{discrete} speech unit space. In this

counting many times, which is expensive in theory. Knowledge compilation
compiles instances into representations on which counting works in polynomial
time. However, these techniques exist only for CNF formulas, and compiling ASP

Dynamic Planning with a LLM,0.989497,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve many NLP tasks in zero-shot

Given Earth imagery with limited training labels, a base deep neural network

and AI generated data? Will they evolve and improve with the new data sets or
on the contrary will they degrade? Will evolution introduce biases or reduce
diversity in subsequent generations of generative AI tools? What are the
societal implications of the possible degradation of these models? Can we
mitigate the effects of this feedback loop? In this document, we explore the
effect of this interaction and report some initial results using simple
diffusion models trained with various image datasets. Our results show that the
quality and diversity of the generated images can degrade over time suggesting
that incorporating AI-created data can have undesired effects on future

Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions,0.410679,"Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical
issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless
downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of
people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time
and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed
that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current
state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in
this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple
technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we
empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 de-biased
(intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is
significantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training
examples, our few-shot debiasing approach is highly feasible and practical.
Through extensive experimentation, we show that our debiasing technique
performs better than competitive state-of-the-art baselines with minimal loss

Bayesian Neural Networks Avoid Encoding Complex and Perturbation-Sensitive Concepts,0.275121,"In this paper, we focus on mean-field variational Bayesian Neural Networks

which types of concepts are less likely to be encoded by the BNN. It has been

usually emerge in the knowledge representation of a sufficiently-trained neural
network, and such concepts can faithfully explain the network output. Based on
this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs),
it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our
theoretical proofs. Note that the tendency to encode less complex concepts does

MoStGAN-V: Video Generation with Temporal Motion Styles,0.700254,"Video generation remains a challenging task due to spatiotemporal complexity
and the requirement of synthesizing diverse motions with temporal consistency.
Previous works attempt to generate videos in arbitrary lengths either in an
autoregressive manner or regarding time as a continuous signal. However, they
struggle to synthesize detailed and diverse motions with temporal coherence and
tend to generate repetitive scenes after a few time steps. In this work, we
argue that a single time-agnostic latent vector of style-based generator is
insufficient to model various and temporally-consistent motions. Hence, we
introduce additional time-dependent motion styles to model diverse motion
patterns. In addition, a Motion Style Attention modulation mechanism, dubbed as
MoStAtt, is proposed to augment frames with vivid dynamics for each specific
scale (i.e., layer), which assigns attention score for each motion style w.r.t
deconvolution filter weights in the target synthesis layer and softly attends
different motion styles for weight modulation. Experimental results show our

Exploring Large Language Models for Human Mobility Prediction under Public Events,0.773698,"Public events, such as concerts and sports games, can be major attractors for
large crowds, leading to irregular surges in travel demand. Accurate human
mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as
well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about
public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to
encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing
methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling
data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public
events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their
unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and
generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms
raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized
format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and
event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in
making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and
event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City,
based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show
that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with
textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers
interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of
LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs

OCTraN: 3D Occupancy Convolutional Transformer Network in Unstructured Traffic Scenarios,0.308986,"Modern approaches for vision-centric environment perception for autonomous

challenge of accurate ranging with low-cost sensors, we propose, OCTraN, a
transformer architecture that uses iterative-attention to convert 2D image
features into 3D occupancy features and makes use of convolution and transpose
convolution to efficiently operate on spatial information. We also develop a

Have it your way: Individualized Privacy Assignment for DP-SGD,0.714111,"When training a machine learning model with differential privacy, one sets a
privacy budget. This budget represents a maximal privacy violation that any

argue that this approach is limited because different users may have different
privacy expectations. Thus, setting a uniform privacy budget across all points
may be overly conservative for some users or, conversely, not sufficiently
protective for others. In this paper, we capture these preferences through
individualized privacy budgets. To demonstrate their practicality, we introduce
a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) which
supports such individualized budgets. DP-SGD is the canonical approach to
training models with differential privacy. We modify its data sampling and
gradient noising mechanisms to arrive at our approach, which we call

Dual-level Interaction for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,0.146989,"Self-training approach recently secures its position in domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, where a model is trained with target domain
pseudo-labels. Current advances have mitigated noisy pseudo-labels resulting
from the domain gap. However, they still struggle with erroneous pseudo-labels

Fusing Visual Appearance and Geometry for Multi-modality 6DoF Object Tracking,0.422977,"In many applications of advanced robotic manipulation, six degrees of freedom

In general, object surfaces contain local characteristics from text, graphics,

Dynamic Sparse No Training: Training-Free Fine-tuning for Sparse LLMs,0.593364,"The ever-increasing large language models (LLMs), though opening a potential
path for the upcoming artificial general intelligence, sadly drops a daunting
obstacle on the way towards their on-device deployment. As one of the most
well-established pre-LLMs approaches in reducing model complexity, network
pruning appears to lag behind in the era of LLMs, due mostly to its costly
fine-tuning (or re-training) necessity under the massive volumes of model
parameter and training data. To close this industry-academia gap, we introduce
Dynamic Sparse No Training (DSnoT), a training-free fine-tuning approach that
slightly updates sparse LLMs without the expensive backpropagation and any
weight updates. Inspired by the Dynamic Sparse Training, DSnoT minimizes the
reconstruction error between the dense and sparse LLMs, in the fashion of
performing iterative weight pruning-and-growing on top of sparse LLMs. To
accomplish this purpose, DSnoT particularly takes into account the anticipated
reduction in reconstruction error for pruning and growing, as well as the
variance w.r.t. different input data for growing each weight. This practice can
be executed efficiently in linear time since its obviates the need of
backpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2,

Robust Domain Misinformation Detection via Multi-modal Feature Alignment,0.738281,"Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is
potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images),
which accounts for higher ""credibility"" than text-only news pieces. Although
existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable
performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from
various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly
training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to
generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source
domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift
focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario
where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in
an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation
trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before
catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and
cross-modal approach (\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection.
It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and
visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the
semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module.
We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios
of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and
domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available).

proven potential in improving model explainability, it opens risks by
reinforcing the notion that models can be trusted for factuality. We call for

Finding Alignments Between Interpretable Causal Variables and Distributed Neural Representations,0.91337,"Causal abstraction is a promising theoretical framework for explainable

IMF: Interactive Multimodal Fusion Model for Link Prediction,0.8842,"Link prediction aims to identify potential missing triples in knowledge
graphs. To get better results, some recent studies have introduced multimodal
information to link prediction. However, these methods utilize multimodal
information separately and neglect the complicated interaction between
different modalities. In this paper, we aim at better modeling the
inter-modality information and thus introduce a novel Interactive Multimodal
Fusion (IMF) model to integrate knowledge from different modalities. To this
end, we propose a two-stage multimodal fusion framework to preserve
modality-specific knowledge as well as take advantage of the complementarity
between different modalities. Instead of directly projecting different
modalities into a unified space, our multimodal fusion module limits the
representations of different modalities independent while leverages bilinear
pooling for fusion and incorporates contrastive learning as additional
constraints. Furthermore, the decision fusion module delivers the learned
weighted average over the predictions of all modalities to better incorporate
the complementarity of different modalities. Our approach has been demonstrated
to be effective through empirical evaluations on several real-world datasets.

Adapting the adapters for code-switching in multilingual ASR,0.24436,"Recently, large pre-trained multilingual speech models have shown potential

ways to effectively fine-tune such models on code-switched speech, by
assimilating information from both language adapters at each language

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via Neural Schrödinger Bridge,0.860262,"Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models which simulate

Decomposing Complex Queries for Tip-of-the-tongue Retrieval,0.418106,"When re-finding items, users who forget or are uncertain about identifying

such complex queries by decomposing the query into individual clues, routing
those as sub-queries to specialized retrievers, and ensembling the results.
This approach allows us to take advantage of off-the-shelf retrievers (e.g.,

"Tell, don't show: Declarative facts influence how LLMs generalize",0.0316925,"We examine how large language models (LLMs) generalize from abstract
declarative statements in their training data. As an illustration, consider an
LLM that is prompted to generate weather reports for London in 2050. One
possibility is that the temperatures in the reports match the mean and variance
of reports from 2023 (i.e. matching the statistics of pretraining). Another
possibility is that the reports predict higher temperatures, by incorporating
declarative statements about climate change from scientific papers written in
2023. An example of such a declarative statement is ""global temperatures will
increase by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by 2050"".
  To test the influence of abstract declarative statements, we construct tasks
in which LLMs are finetuned on both declarative and procedural information. We
find that declarative statements influence model predictions, even when they
conflict with procedural information. In particular, finetuning on a
declarative statement $S$ increases the model likelihood for logical
consequences of $S$. The effect of declarative statements is consistent across
three domains: aligning an AI assistant, predicting weather, and predicting
demographic features. Through a series of ablations, we show that the effect of
declarative statements cannot be explained by associative learning based on
matching keywords. Nevertheless, the effect of declarative statements on model
likelihoods is small in absolute terms and increases surprisingly little with

Solving Travelling Thief Problems using Coordination Based Methods,0.517159,"A travelling thief problem (TTP) is a proxy to real-life problems such as
postal collection. TTP comprises an entanglement of a travelling salesman
problem (TSP) and a knapsack problem (KP) since items of KP are scattered over

selection and item selection decisions need close coordination since the
thief's travelling speed depends on the knapsack's weight and the order of
visiting cities affects the order of item collection. Existing TTP solvers deal
with city selection and item selection separately, keeping decisions for one
type unchanged while dealing with the other type. This separation essentially
means very poor coordination between two types of decision. In this paper, we

Prompt-Based Tuning of Transformer Models for Multi-Center Medical Image Segmentation of Head and Neck Cancer,0.180877,"Medical image segmentation is a vital healthcare endeavor requiring precise
and efficient models for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Vision
transformer (ViT)-based segmentation models have shown great performance in
accomplishing this task. However, to build a powerful backbone, the
self-attention block of ViT requires large-scale pre-training data. The present
method of modifying pre-trained models entails updating all or some of the
backbone parameters. This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning strategy for
adapting a pretrained transformer-based segmentation model on data from a new
medical center. This method introduces a small number of learnable parameters,
termed prompts, into the input space (less than 1\% of model parameters) while
keeping the rest of the model parameters frozen. Extensive studies employing
data from new unseen medical centers show that the prompt-based fine-tuning of
medical segmentation models provides excellent performance regarding the
new-center data with a negligible drop regarding the old centers. Additionally,
our strategy delivers great accuracy with minimum re-training on new-center
data, significantly decreasing the computational and time costs of fine-tuning
pre-trained models.",None,-1

On the Generalization of Training-based ChatGPT Detection Methods,0.157527,"ChatGPT is one of the most popular language models which achieve amazing

Analytical reconstructions of full-scan multiple source-translation computed tomography under large field of views,0.293778,"This paper is to investigate the high-quality analytical reconstructions of
multiple source-translation computed tomography (mSTCT) under an extended field
of view (FOV). Under the larger FOVs, the previously proposed backprojection
filtration (BPF) algorithms for mSTCT, including D-BPF and S-BPF (their
differences are different derivate directions along the detector and source,
respectively), make some errors and artifacts in the reconstructed images due
to a backprojection weighting factor and the half-scan mode, which deviates
from the intention of mSTCT imaging. In this paper, to achieve reconstruction
with as little error as possible under the extremely extended FOV, we combine
the full-scan mSTCT (F-mSTCT) geometry with the previous BPF algorithms to
study the performance and derive a suitable redundancy-weighted function for
F-mSTCT. The experimental results indicate FS-BPF can get high-quality, stable

Efficient Bayesian Computational Imaging with a Surrogate Score-Based Prior,0.524051,"We propose a surrogate function for efficient use of score-based priors for
Bayesian inverse imaging. Recent work turned score-based diffusion models into

high-dimensional images. Our proposed surrogate prior is based on the evidence
lower-bound of a score-based diffusion model. We demonstrate the surrogate
prior on variational inference for efficient approximate posterior sampling of
large images. Compared to the exact prior in previous work, our surrogate prior
accelerates optimization of the variational image distribution by at least two

Can LMs Learn New Entities from Descriptions? Challenges in Propagating Injected Knowledge,0.629679,"Pre-trained language models (LMs) are used for knowledge intensive tasks like
question answering, but their knowledge gets continuously outdated as the world
changes. Prior work has studied targeted updates to LMs, injecting individual
facts and evaluating whether the model learns these facts while not changing
predictions on other contexts. We take a step forward and study LMs' abilities
to make inferences based on injected facts (or propagate those facts): for
example, after learning that something is a TV show, does an LM predict that
you can watch it? We study this with two cloze-style tasks: an existing dataset
of real-world sentences about novel entities (ECBD) as well as a new controlled
benchmark with manually designed templates requiring varying levels of
inference about injected knowledge. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods
for updating knowledge (gradient-based fine-tuning and modifications of this
approach) show little propagation of injected knowledge. These methods improve
performance on cloze instances only when there is lexical overlap between
injected facts and target inferences. Yet, prepending entity definitions in an
LM's context improves performance across all settings, suggesting that there is
substantial headroom for parameter-updating approaches for knowledge injection.",None,-1

Precise Benchmarking of Explainable AI Attribution Methods,0.102041,"The rationale behind a deep learning model's output is often difficult to
understand by humans. EXplainable AI (XAI) aims at solving this by developing
methods that improve interpretability and explainability of machine learning
models. Reliable evaluation metrics are needed to assess and compare different
XAI methods. We propose a novel evaluation approach for benchmarking
state-of-the-art XAI attribution methods. Our proposal consists of a synthetic
classification model accompanied by its derived ground truth explanations
allowing high precision representation of input nodes contributions. We also
propose new high-fidelity metrics to quantify the difference between
explanations of the investigated XAI method and those derived from the
synthetic model. Our metrics allow assessment of explanations in terms of
precision and recall separately. Also, we propose metrics to independently
evaluate negative or positive contributions of inputs. Our proposal provides
deeper insights into XAI methods output. We investigate our proposal by
constructing a synthetic convolutional image classification model and
benchmarking several widely used XAI attribution methods using our evaluation
approach. We compare our results with established prior XAI evaluation metrics.
By deriving the ground truth directly from the constructed model in our method,
we ensure the absence of bias, e.g., subjective either based on the training
set. Our experimental results provide novel insights into the performance of
Guided-Backprop and Smoothgrad XAI methods that are widely in use. Both have
good precision and recall scores among positively contributing pixels (0.7,
0.76 and 0.7, 0.77, respectively), but poor precision scores among negatively
contributing pixels (0.44, 0.61 and 0.47, 0.75, resp.). The recall scores in
the latter case remain close. We show that our metrics are among the fastest in
terms of execution time.",None,-1
Graph-Induced Syntactic-Semantic Spaces in Transformer-Based Variational AutoEncoders,0.580866,"The injection of syntactic information in Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) has
been shown to result in an overall improvement of performances and
generalisation. An effective strategy to achieve such a goal is to separate the
encoding of distributional semantic features and syntactic structures into
heterogeneous latent spaces via multi-task learning or dual encoder
architectures. However, existing works employing such techniques are limited to
LSTM-based VAEs. In this paper, we investigate latent space separation methods
for structural syntactic injection in Transformer-based VAE architectures
(i.e., Optimus). Specifically, we explore how syntactic structures can be
leveraged in the encoding stage through the integration of graph-based and
sequential models, and how multiple, specialised latent representations can be
injected into the decoder's attention mechanism via low-rank operators. Our
empirical evaluation, carried out on natural language sentences and
mathematical expressions, reveals that the proposed end-to-end VAE architecture
can result in a better overall organisation of the latent space, alleviating
the information loss occurring in standard VAE setups, resulting in enhanced
performances on language modelling and downstream generation tasks.",None,-1
Predictive Heterogeneity: Measures and Applications,0.0716784,"As an intrinsic and fundamental property of big data, data heterogeneity
exists in a variety of real-world applications, such as precision medicine,
autonomous driving, financial applications, etc. For machine learning
algorithms, the ignorance of data heterogeneity will greatly hurt the
generalization performance and the algorithmic fairness, since the prediction
mechanisms among different sub-populations are likely to differ from each
other. In this work, we focus on the data heterogeneity that affects the
prediction of machine learning models, and firstly propose the \emph{usable
predictive heterogeneity}, which takes into account the model capacity and
computational constraints. We prove that it can be reliably estimated from
finite data with probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds. Additionally, we
design a bi-level optimization algorithm to explore the usable predictive
heterogeneity from data. Empirically, the explored heterogeneity provides
insights for sub-population divisions in income prediction, crop yield
prediction and image classification tasks, and leveraging such heterogeneity
benefits the out-of-distribution generalization performance.",None,-1
Cross-Modality Time-Variant Relation Learning for Generating Dynamic Scene Graphs,0.620706,"Dynamic scene graphs generated from video clips could help enhance the
semantic visual understanding in a wide range of challenging tasks such as
environmental perception, autonomous navigation, and task planning of
self-driving vehicles and mobile robots. In the process of temporal and spatial
modeling during dynamic scene graph generation, it is particularly intractable
to learn time-variant relations in dynamic scene graphs among frames. In this
paper, we propose a Time-variant Relation-aware TRansformer (TR$^2$), which
aims to model the temporal change of relations in dynamic scene graphs.
Explicitly, we leverage the difference of text embeddings of prompted sentences
about relation labels as the supervision signal for relations. In this way,
cross-modality feature guidance is realized for the learning of time-variant
relations. Implicitly, we design a relation feature fusion module with a
transformer and an additional message token that describes the difference
between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset

Semantic Channel Equalizer: Modelling Language Mismatch in Multi-User Semantic Communications,0.700326,"We consider a multi-user semantic communications system in which agents
(transmitters and receivers) interact through the exchange of semantic messages
to convey meanings. In this context, languages are instrumental in structuring
the construction and consolidation of knowledge, influencing conceptual
representation and semantic extraction and interpretation. Yet, the crucial
role of languages in semantic communications is often overlooked. When this is
not the case, agent languages are assumed compatible and unambiguously
interoperable, ignoring practical limitations that may arise due to language
mismatching. This is the focus of this work. When agents use distinct
languages, message interpretation is prone to semantic noise resulting from
critical distortion introduced by semantic channels. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a new semantic channel equalizer to counteract and limit
the critical ambiguity in message interpretation. Our proposed solution models
the mismatch of languages with measurable transformations over semantic
representation spaces. We achieve this using optimal transport theory, where we
model such transformations as transportation maps. Then, to recover at the
receiver the meaning intended by the teacher we operate semantic equalization
to compensate for the transformation introduced by the semantic channel, either
before transmission and/or after the reception of semantic messages. We
implement the proposed approach as an operation over a codebook of
transformations specifically designed for successful communication. Numerical
results show that the proposed semantic channel equalizer outperforms
traditional approaches in terms of operational complexity and transmission
accuracy.",None,-1

Chasing Consistency in Text-to-3D Generation from a Single Image,0.500005,"Text-to-3D generation from a single-view image is a popular but challenging
task in 3D vision. Although numerous methods have been proposed, existing works
still suffer from the inconsistency issues, including 1) semantic
inconsistency, 2) geometric inconsistency, and 3) saturation inconsistency,
resulting in distorted, overfitted, and over-saturated generations. In light of
the above issues, we present Consist3D, a three-stage framework Chasing for
semantic-, geometric-, and saturation-Consistent Text-to-3D generation from a
single image, in which the first two stages aim to learn parameterized
consistency tokens, and the last stage is for optimization. Specifically, the
semantic encoding stage learns a token independent of views and estimations,
promoting semantic consistency and robustness. Meanwhile, the geometric
encoding stage learns another token with comprehensive geometry and
reconstruction constraints under novel-view estimations, reducing overfitting
and encouraging geometric consistency. Finally, the optimization stage benefits
from the semantic and geometric tokens, allowing a low classifier-free guidance
scale and therefore preventing oversaturation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Consist3D produces more consistent, faithful, and photo-realistic 3D

Overwriting Pretrained Bias with Finetuning Data,0.406082,"Transfer learning is beneficial by allowing the expressive features of models
pretrained on large-scale datasets to be finetuned for the target task of
smaller, more domain-specific datasets. However, there is a concern that these
pretrained models may come with their own biases which would propagate into the
finetuned model. In this work, we investigate bias when conceptualized as both
spurious correlations between the target task and a sensitive attribute as well
as underrepresentation of a particular group in the dataset. Under both notions
of bias, we find that (1) models finetuned on top of pretrained models can
indeed inherit their biases, but (2) this bias can be corrected for through
relatively minor interventions to the finetuning dataset, and often with a
negligible impact to performance. Our findings imply that careful curation of
the finetuning dataset is important for reducing biases on a downstream task,
and doing so can even compensate for bias in the pretrained model.",None,-1

DeGPR: Deep Guided Posterior Regularization for Multi-Class Cell Detection and Counting,0.523711,"Multi-class cell detection and counting is an essential task for many

Rumor Detection with Diverse Counterfactual Evidence,0.162872,"The growth in social media has exacerbated the threat of fake news to
individuals and communities. This draws increasing attention to developing
efficient and timely rumor detection methods. The prevailing approaches resort
to graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit the post-propagation patterns of the
rumor-spreading process. However, these methods lack inherent interpretation of
rumor detection due to the black-box nature of GNNs. Moreover, these methods
suffer from less robust results as they employ all the propagation patterns for
rumor detection. In this paper, we address the above issues with the proposed
Diverse Counterfactual Evidence framework for Rumor Detection (DCE-RD). Our
intuition is to exploit the diverse counterfactual evidence of an event graph
to serve as multi-view interpretations, which are further aggregated for robust
rumor detection results. Specifically, our method first designs a subgraph
generation strategy to efficiently generate different subgraphs of the event
graph. We constrain the removal of these subgraphs to cause the change in rumor
detection results. Thus, these subgraphs naturally serve as counterfactual
evidence for rumor detection. To achieve multi-view interpretation, we design a
diversity loss inspired by Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to encourage
diversity among the counterfactual evidence. A GNN-based rumor detection model
further aggregates the diverse counterfactual evidence discovered by the
proposed DCE-RD to achieve interpretable and robust rumor detection results.

Prior studies find in many decision making contexts AI explanations do not
facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow

resolve ambiguous symmetries in any given image pair (such as the handle of a
mug that becomes visible in a third view). Second, we augment this network to
also report camera translations by defining an appropriate coordinate system

SLiC-HF: Sequence Likelihood Calibration with Human Feedback,1.0,"Learning from human feedback has been shown to be effective at aligning
language models with human preferences. Past work has often relied on
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which optimizes the language

Likelihood Calibration (SLiC), can also be used to effectively learn from human
preferences (SLiC-HF). Furthermore, we demonstrate this can be done with human
feedback data collected for a different model, similar to off-policy, offline
RL data. Automatic and human evaluation experiments on the TL;DR summarization

Furthermore, SLiC-HF presents a competitive alternative to the PPO RLHF

Large Linguistic Models: Analyzing theoretical linguistic abilities of LLMs,0.864471,"The performance of large language models (LLMs) has recently improved to the
point where the models can perform well on many language tasks. We show here

analyses of linguistic data and illustrate the vast potential of large language
models for analyses of their metalinguistic abilities. LLMs are primarily
trained on language data in the form of text; analyzing and evaluating their
metalinguistic abilities improves our understanding of their general
capabilities and sheds new light on theoretical models in linguistics. In this
paper, we probe into GPT-4's metalinguistic capabilities by focusing on three
subfields of formal linguistics: syntax, phonology, and semantics. We outline a
research program for metalinguistic analyses of large language models, propose
experimental designs, provide general guidelines, discuss limitations, and
offer future directions for this line of research. This line of inquiry also

BiLMa: Bidirectional Local-Matching for Text-based Person Re-identification,0.826398,"Text-based person re-identification (TBPReID) aims to retrieve person images
represented by a given textual query. In this task, how to effectively align
images and texts globally and locally is a crucial challenge. Recent works have
obtained high performances by solving Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to align
image/text parts. However, they only performed uni-directional (i.e., from
image to text) local-matching, leaving room for improvement by introducing
opposite-directional (i.e., from text to image) local-matching. In this work,

Stable Yaw Estimation of Boats from the Viewpoint of UAVs and USVs,0.0658819,"Yaw estimation of boats from the viewpoint of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or boats is a crucial task in various
applications such as 3D scene rendering, trajectory prediction, and navigation.
However, the lack of literature on yaw estimation of objects from the viewpoint

method based on HyperPosePDF for predicting the orientation of boats in the 6D
space. For that, we use existing datasets, such as PASCAL3D+ and our own
datasets, SeaDronesSee-3D and BOArienT, which we annotated manually. We extend
HyperPosePDF to work in video-based scenarios, such that it yields robust
orientation predictions across time. Naively applying HyperPosePDF on video
data yields single-point predictions, resulting in far-off predictions and
often incorrect symmetric orientations due to unseen or visually different

distributions of pose predictions, resulting in significantly improved
performance, as shown in our experimental evaluation. Our proposed method could

Fine-tuned vs. Prompt-tuned Supervised Representations: Which Better Account for Brain Language Representations?,0.487268,"To decipher the algorithm underlying the human brain's language
representation, previous work probed brain responses to language input with
pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) models fine-tuned on NLU tasks.
However, full fine-tuning generally updates the entire parametric space and
distorts pre-trained features, cognitively inconsistent with the brain's robust
multi-task learning ability. Prompt-tuning, in contrast, protects pre-trained
weights and learns task-specific embeddings to fit a task. Could prompt-tuning
generate representations that better account for the brain's language
representations than fine-tuning? If so, what kind of NLU task leads a
pre-trained model to better decode the information represented in the human
brain? We investigate these questions by comparing prompt-tuned and fine-tuned
representations in neural decoding, that is predicting the linguistic stimulus
from the brain activities evoked by the stimulus. We find that on none of the
10 NLU tasks, full fine-tuning significantly outperforms prompt-tuning in
neural decoding, implicating that a more brain-consistent tuning method yields
representations that better correlate with brain data. Moreover, we identify
that tasks dealing with fine-grained concept meaning yield representations that
better decode brain activation patterns than other tasks, especially the
syntactic chunking task. This indicates that our brain encodes more
fine-grained concept information than shallow syntactic information when
representing languages.",None,-1
Enhancing Embedding Representations of Biomedical Data using Logic Knowledge,0.0823712,"Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) have become a quite popular class of models
specifically devised to deal with ontologies and graph structure data, as they
can implicitly encode statistical dependencies between entities and relations
in a latent space. KGE techniques are particularly effective for the biomedical
domain, where it is quite common to deal with large knowledge graphs underlying
complex interactions between biological and chemical objects. Recently in the
literature, the PharmKG dataset has been proposed as one of the most
challenging knowledge graph biomedical benchmark, with hundreds of thousands of
relational facts between genes, diseases and chemicals. Despite KGEs can scale
to very large relational domains, they generally fail at representing more
complex relational dependencies between facts, like logic rules, which may be
fundamental in complex experimental settings. In this paper, we exploit logic
rules to enhance the embedding representations of KGEs on the PharmKG dataset.
To this end, we adopt Relational Reasoning Network (R2N), a recently proposed
neural-symbolic approach showing promising results on knowledge graph
completion tasks. An R2N uses the available logic rules to build a neural
architecture that reasons over KGE latent representations. In the experiments,

How to prepare your task head for finetuning,0.233644,"In deep learning, transferring information from a pretrained network to a
downstream task by finetuning has many benefits. The choice of task head plays
an important role in fine-tuning, as the pretrained and downstream tasks are
usually different. Although there exist many different designs for finetuning,
a full understanding of when and why these algorithms work has been elusive. We
analyze how the choice of task head controls feature adaptation and hence
influences the downstream performance. By decomposing the learning dynamics of
adaptation, we find that the key aspect is the training accuracy and loss at
the beginning of finetuning, which determines the ""energy"" available for the
feature's adaptation. We identify a significant trend in the effect of changes
in this initial energy on the resulting features after fine-tuning.
Specifically, as the energy increases, the Euclidean and cosine distances
between the resulting and original features increase, while their dot products
(and the resulting features' norm) first increase and then decrease. Inspired
by this, we give several practical principles that lead to better downstream
performance. We analytically prove this trend in an overparamterized linear
setting and verify its applicability to different experimental settings.",None,-1
Parkinson gait modelling from an anomaly deep representation,0.217655,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with gait movement disorders, such as

In-Context Impersonation Reveals Large Language Models' Strengths and Biases,0.424797,"In everyday conversations, humans can take on different roles and adapt their
vocabulary to their chosen roles. We explore whether LLMs can take on, that is
impersonate, different roles when they generate text in-context. We ask LLMs to
assume different personas before solving vision and language tasks. We do this
by prefixing the prompt with a persona that is associated either with a social
identity or domain expertise. In a multi-armed bandit task, we find that LLMs
pretending to be children of different ages recover human-like developmental
stages of exploration. In a language-based reasoning task, we find that LLMs
impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain
experts. Finally, we test whether LLMs' impersonations are complementary to
visual information when describing different categories. We find that
impersonation can improve performance: an LLM prompted to be a bird expert
describes birds better than one prompted to be a car expert. However,
impersonation can also uncover LLMs' biases: an LLM prompted to be a man

Not Only Generative Art: Stable Diffusion for Content-Style Disentanglement in Art Analysis,0.371777,"The duality of content and style is inherent to the nature of art. For

Accelerated Coordinate Encoding: Learning to Relocalize in Minutes using RGB and Poses,0.282319,"Learning-based visual relocalizers exhibit leading pose accuracy, but require

obvious: using an MLP prediction head allows us to optimize across thousands of
view points simultaneously in each single training iteration. This leads to
stable and extremely fast convergence. Furthermore, we substitute effective but

NeRFMeshing: Distilling Neural Radiance Fields into Geometrically-Accurate 3D Meshes,0.857539,"With the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), novel view synthesis

Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations in Multilingual Summarisation,0.859355,"Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of neural

Robust Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery with Delays,0.620802,"Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is the problem of computing

Towards Explainable TOPSIS: Visual Insights into the Effects of Weights and Aggregations on Rankings,0.545257,"Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is extensively used across diverse
industries to assess and rank alternatives. Among numerous MCDA methods
developed to solve real-world ranking problems, TOPSIS remains one of the most
popular choices in many application areas. TOPSIS calculates distances between
the considered alternatives and two predefined ones, namely the ideal and the
anti-ideal, and creates a ranking of the alternatives according to a chosen
aggregation of these distances. However, the interpretation of the inner
workings of TOPSIS is difficult, especially when the number of criteria is
large. To this end, recent research has shown that TOPSIS aggregations can be
expressed using the means (M) and standard deviations (SD) of alternatives,
creating MSD-space, a tool for visualizing and explaining aggregations. Even

Video ControlNet: Towards Temporally Consistent Synthetic-to-Real Video Translation Using Conditional Image Diffusion Models,0.55578,"In this study, we present an efficient and effective approach for achieving
temporally consistent synthetic-to-real video translation in videos of varying
lengths. Our method leverages off-the-shelf conditional image diffusion models,
allowing us to perform multiple synthetic-to-real image generations in
parallel. By utilizing the available optical flow information from the
synthetic videos, our approach seamlessly enforces temporal consistency among
corresponding pixels across frames. This is achieved through joint noise
optimization, effectively minimizing spatial and temporal discrepancies. To the
best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first to accomplish diverse
and temporally consistent synthetic-to-real video translation using conditional
image diffusion models. Furthermore, our approach does not require any training
or fine-tuning of the diffusion models. Extensive experiments conducted on

NLLB-CLIP -- train performant multilingual image retrieval model on a budget,0.556889,"Today, the exponential rise of large models developed by academic and
industrial institutions with the help of massive computing resources raises the
question of whether someone without access to such resources can make a
valuable scientific contribution. To explore this, we tried to solve the

Improving Online Lane Graph Extraction by Object-Lane Clustering,0.506368,"Autonomous driving requires accurate local scene understanding information.
To this end, autonomous agents deploy object detection and online BEV lane
graph extraction methods as a part of their perception stack. In this work, we

better performance. The proposed method improves lane graph estimation
substantially over state-of-the-art methods. The extensive ablations show that

FREDOM: Fairness Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding,0.726271,"Although Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Segmentation has shown

Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling,0.398139,"Self-attention-based models have achieved remarkable progress in short-text

Tied-Augment: Controlling Representation Similarity Improves Data Augmentation,0.194263,"Data augmentation methods have played an important role in the recent advance

"OVM, Outcome-supervised Value Models for Planning in Mathematical Reasoning",0.517995,"Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining accuracy
throughout multiple multiple reasoning steps, especially in mathematical
reasoning where an error in earlier steps can propagate to subsequent ones and
it ultimately leading to an incorrect answer. To reduce error propagation,
guided decoding is employed to direct the LM decoding on a step-by-step basis.
We argue that in guided decoding, assessing the potential of an incomplete
reasoning path can be more advantageous than simply ensuring per-step
correctness, as the former approach leads towards a correct final answer. This
transforms the task into a $\textit{value estimation}$ problem in planning.
  Inspired by the findings that $\textit{outcome supervision for guided

Target-oriented Proactive Dialogue Systems with Personalization: Problem Formulation and Dataset Curation,0.804045,"Target-oriented dialogue systems, designed to proactively steer conversations
toward predefined targets or accomplish specific system-side goals, are an
exciting area in conversational AI. In this work, by formulating a <dialogue

personalized target-oriented dialogue by considering personalization during the
target accomplishment process. However, there remains an emergent need for
high-quality datasets, and building one from scratch requires tremendous human
effort. To address this, we propose an automatic dataset curation framework
using a role-playing approach. Based on this framework, we construct a

comprises about 18K multi-turn dialogues. The experimental results show that
this dataset is of high quality and could contribute to exploring personalized

SegPrompt: Using Segmentation Map as a Better Prompt to Finetune Deep Models for Kidney Stone Classification,0.572601,"Recently, deep learning has produced encouraging results for kidney stone
classification using endoscope images. However, the shortage of annotated
training data poses a severe problem in improving the performance and
generalization ability of the trained model. It is thus crucial to fully
exploit the limited data at hand. In this paper, we propose SegPrompt to
alleviate the data shortage problems by exploiting segmentation maps from two
aspects. First, SegPrompt integrates segmentation maps to facilitate
classification training so that the classification model is aware of the
regions of interest. The proposed method allows the image and segmentation
tokens to interact with each other to fully utilize the segmentation map
information. Second, we use the segmentation maps as prompts to tune the
pretrained deep model, resulting in much fewer trainable parameters than
vanilla finetuning. We perform extensive experiments on the collected kidney
stone dataset. The results show that SegPrompt can achieve an advantageous
balance between the model fitting ability and the generalization ability,
eventually leading to an effective model with limited training data.",None,-1

Can LLMs Augment Low-Resource Reading Comprehension Datasets? Opportunities and Challenges,0.213675,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero shot

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 as a replacement for human

ESMC: Entire Space Multi-Task Model for Post-Click Conversion Rate via Parameter Constraint,0.534718,"Large-scale online recommender system spreads all over the Internet being in
charge of two basic tasks: Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Post-Click Conversion

well-known Sample Selection Bias and Data Sparsity issues. Entire space models
were proposed to address the two issues via tracing the decision-making path of
""exposure_click_purchase"". Further, some researchers observed that there are
purchase-related behaviors between click and purchase, which can better draw
the user's decision-making intention and improve the recommendation
performance. Thus, the decision-making path has been extended to
""exposure_click_in-shop action_purchase"" and can be modeled with conditional
probability approach. Nevertheless, we observe that the chain rule of
conditional probability does not always hold. We report Probability Space
Confusion (PSC) issue and give a derivation of difference between ground-truth

On The Convergence Of Policy Iteration-Based Reinforcement Learning With Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation,0.136966,"A common technique in reinforcement learning is to evaluate the value
function from Monte Carlo simulations of a given policy, and use the estimated
value function to obtain a new policy which is greedy with respect to the

a policy is estimated from data collected from a single sample path obtained
from implementing the policy (see page 99 of [Sutton and Barto, 2018], page 8
of [Tsitsiklis, 2002]). We present a solution to the open problem by showing
that a first-visit version of such a policy iteration scheme indeed converges
to the optimal policy provided that the policy improvement step uses lookahead

Dr.ICL: Demonstration-Retrieved In-context Learning,0.647619,"In-context learning (ICL), teaching a large language model (LLM) to perform a

This work expands the applicability of retrieval-based ICL approaches by
demonstrating that even simple word-overlap similarity measures such as BM25
outperform randomly selected demonstrations. Furthermore, we extend the success
of retrieval-based ICL to instruction-finetuned LLMs as well as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For instruction-finetuned LLMs, we find that
although a model has already seen the training data at training time,
retrieving demonstrations from the training data at test time yields better
results compared to using no demonstrations or random demonstrations. Last but

Self-supervised Pre-training with Masked Shape Prediction for 3D Scene Understanding,0.522717,"Masked signal modeling has greatly advanced self-supervised pre-training for

contextual cues in shape prediction. Meanwhile, the pre-training architecture

Coherent Concept-based Explanations in Medical Image and Its Application to Skin Lesion Diagnosis,0.733773,"Early detection of melanoma is crucial for preventing severe complications

Discourse Structures Guided Fine-grained Propaganda Identification,0.375043,"Propaganda is a form of deceptive narratives that instigate or mislead the

Unified Open-Vocabulary Dense Visual Prediction,0.226108,"In recent years, open-vocabulary (OV) dense visual prediction (such as OV

Unstoppable Attack: Label-Only Model Inversion via Conditional Diffusion Model,0.051095,"Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to recover private data from inaccessible

black-box scenarios or label-only scenarios, i.e., the attackers can only

Therefore, the attack models in existing MIAs are difficult to effectively

Getting too personal(ized): The importance of feature choice in online adaptive algorithms,0.214496,"Digital educational technologies offer the potential to customize students'
experiences and learn what works for which students, enhancing the technology

explore these issues in the context of using multi-armed bandit (MAB)
algorithms to learn a policy for what version of an educational technology to
present to each student, varying the relation between student characteristics
and outcomes and also whether the algorithm is aware of these characteristics.
Through simulations, we demonstrate that the inclusion of student
characteristics for personalization can be beneficial when those
characteristics are needed to learn the optimal action. In other scenarios,
this inclusion decreases performance of the bandit algorithm. Moreover,
including unneeded student characteristics can systematically disadvantage
students with less common values for these characteristics. Our simulations do
however suggest that real-time personalization will be helpful in particular
real-world scenarios, and we illustrate this through case studies using
existing experimental results in ASSISTments. Overall, our simulations show

Test Time Adaptation for Blind Image Quality Assessment,0.86683,"While the design of blind image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms has

agent density grows. To address these challenges in lifelong MAPF, we explore
the idea of highways mainly studied for one-shot MAPF (i.e., finding paths at

agents to move in the same direction. We utilize two methods to incorporate the
highway idea into the lifelong MAPF framework and discuss the properties that
minimize the existing problems of deadlocks and rerouting. The experimental

CrossSpeech: Speaker-independent Acoustic Representation for Cross-lingual Speech Synthesis,0.641148,"While recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems have made remarkable strides toward
human-level quality, the performance of cross-lingual TTS lags behind that of
intra-lingual TTS. This gap is mainly rooted from the speaker-language
entanglement problem in cross-lingual TTS. In this paper, we propose
CrossSpeech which improves the quality of cross-lingual speech by effectively
disentangling speaker and language information in the level of acoustic feature
space. Specifically, CrossSpeech decomposes the speech generation pipeline into
the speaker-independent generator (SIG) and speaker-dependent generator (SDG).
The SIG produces the speaker-independent acoustic representation which is not
biased to specific speaker distributions. On the other hand, the SDG models
speaker-dependent speech variation that characterizes speaker attributes. By
handling each information separately, CrossSpeech can obtain disentangled
speaker and language representations. From the experiments, we verify that
CrossSpeech achieves significant improvements in cross-lingual TTS, especially
in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker.",None,-1

Document-level Relation Extraction with Cross-sentence Reasoning Graph,0.844489,"Relation extraction (RE) has recently moved from the sentence-level to
document-level, which requires aggregating document information and using

only focus on entity-level reasoning paths without considering global
interactions among entities cross-sentence. To these ends, we propose a novel
document-level RE model with a GRaph information Aggregation and Cross-sentence
Reasoning network (GRACR). Specifically, a simplified document-level graph is
constructed to model the semantic information of all mentions and sentences in
a document, and an entity-level graph is designed to explore relations of
long-distance cross-sentence entity pairs. Experimental results show that GRACR
achieves excellent performance on two public datasets of document-level RE. It

injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (i.e., things),
paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to

establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation.
Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward

Pre-training Contextual Location Embeddings in Personal Trajectories via Efficient Hierarchical Location Representations,0.208703,"Pre-training the embedding of a location generated from human mobility data
