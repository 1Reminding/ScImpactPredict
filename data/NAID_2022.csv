evaluation is limited to in-domain evaluation setups. Little is known on how
well a RE system fares in challenging, but realistic out-of-distribution
evaluation setups. To address this gap, we propose CrossRE, a new,
freely-available cross-domain benchmark for RE, which comprises six distinct
text domains and includes multi-label annotations. An additional innovation is
that we release meta-data collected during annotation, to include explanations
and flags of difficult instances. We provide an empirical evaluation with a
state-of-the-art model for relation classification. As the meta-data enables us
to shed new light on the state-of-the-art model, we provide a comprehensive
analysis on the impact of difficult cases and find correlations between model
and human annotations. Overall, our empirical investigation highlights the
difficulty of cross-domain RE. We release our dataset, to spur more research in
this direction.",https://github.com/mainlp/CrossRE,-1

precision validated by different data sets with trivial cost on detection
speed. Our previous work on detecting polyps within colonoscopy provided an
efficient end-to-end solution to alleviate doctor's examination overhead.
However, our later experiments found this framework is not as robust as before
as the condition of polyp capturing varies. In this work, we conducted several
studies on data set, identifying main issues that causes low precision rate in
the task of polyp detection. We used an optimized anchor generation methods to
get better anchor box shape and more boxes are used for detection as we believe
this is necessary for small object detection. A alternative backbone is used to
compensate the heavy time cost introduced by dense anchor box regression. With
use of the attention gate module, our model can achieve state-of-the-art polyp
detection performance while still maintain real-time detection speed.",None,-1

introduced. The classifier is based on the previously introduced concept of the
granular approximation and its multi-class classification case. The classifier

ability to explain every individual prediction it makes. We first develop the
FGAC for the binary classification case and the multi-class classification case
and we discuss its variation that includes the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA)
operators. Those variations of the FGAC are then empirically compared with
other locally transparent ML methods. At the end, we discuss the transparency
of the FGAC and its advantage over other locally transparent methods. We
conclude that while the FGAC has similar predictive performance to other
locally transparent ML models, its transparency can be superior in certain
cases.",https://github.com/markopalangetic/FGAC_experiments,28553

objects. We build on the strengths of recent advances in neural reconstruction
and rendering such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). A major shortcoming of
such approaches is that they fail to reconstruct any part of the object which
is not clearly visible in the training image, which is often the case for
in-the-wild images and videos. When evidence is lacking, structural priors such
as symmetry can be used to complete the missing information. However,
exploiting such priors in neural rendering is highly non-trivial: while
geometry and non-reflective materials may be symmetric, shadows and reflections
from the ambient scene are not symmetric in general. To address this, we apply
a soft symmetry constraint to the 3D geometry and material properties, having
factored appearance into lighting, albedo colour and reflectivity. We evaluate
our method on the recently introduced CO3D dataset, focusing on the car
category due to the challenge of reconstructing highly-reflective materials. We
show that it can reconstruct unobserved regions with high fidelity and render

However, building a chat system is not scalable since it often requires a

cases like user profiling which in turn power applications such as advertising,

emotion recognition, the field of mood prediction has been barely explored. In
addition, very little work is done in the area of on-device inferencing, which
is highly important from the user privacy point of view. In this paper, we
propose for the first time, an on-device deep learning approach for mood

attention along with Conditional Random Fields (CRF), results in a performance
closely comparable to that of the current State-Of-the-Art with a significant
reduction in model size (> 90%) for the task of ERC. We achieve a Micro F1

factual knowledge. However, some analyses reveal that PLMs fail to perform it
robustly, e.g., being sensitive to the changes of prompts when extracting

deterministic relationship between the remaining context and the masked

can be deterministically inferable based on the existing clues in the context.
That would provide more stable patterns for PLMs to capture factual knowledge
than randomly masking. Two pre-training tasks are further introduced to
motivate PLMs to rely on the deterministic relationship when filling masks.
Specifically, we use an external Knowledge Base (KB) to identify deterministic
relationships and continuously pre-train PLMs with the proposed methods. The
factual knowledge probing experiments indicate that the continuously
pre-trained PLMs achieve better robustness in factual knowledge capturing.
Further experiments on question-answering datasets show that trying to learn a

However, current 3D point cloud segmentation methods usually perform poorly on

this paper, we focus on the segmentation of scene boundaries. Accordingly, we

propose a novel contrastive boundary learning (CBL) framework for point cloud

between points across boundaries by contrasting their representations with the
assistance of scene contexts at multiple scales. By applying CBL on three
different baseline methods, we experimentally show that CBL consistently

research topic on automatically complementing knowledge graphs. However,
evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the
incompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets
which may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet.
Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption.
This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and
consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation
under a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown
triplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the
training or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean
reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be
unexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing
facts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength
of the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of
reflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we
show that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect
comparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower
metric numbers. We validate the phenomenon both theoretically and

Specifically, we leverage pre-trained language models to construct a

abstractor for rewriting the selected contents as summaries. However, learning
such a framework is challenging since the optimal contents for the abstractor
are generally unknown. Previous works typically create pseudo extraction oracle
to enable the supervised learning for both the extractor and the abstractor.
Nevertheless, we argue that the performance of such methods could be restricted
due to the insufficient information for prediction and inconsistent objectives
between training and testing. To this end, we propose a loss weighting
mechanism that makes the model aware of the unequal importance for the
sentences not in the pseudo extraction oracle, and leverage the fine-tuned
abstractor to generate summary references as auxiliary signals for learning the
extractor. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method that can

the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans
corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q Learning Network based Method (HQM)
is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large
problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is
integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of
exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning methods.
We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200
nodes) and benchmarked it against the exact approach and Genetic Algorithm
(GA). Our results indicate that HQM achieves better optimisation performance
with shorter computation time than the exact approach solved by the Gurobi
solver in large problem instances. Additionally, the average reward obtained by
HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better
optimisation ability. Further, we identify critical factors that contribute to
fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings

of real images as a self-supervised constraint, which alleviates the GAN
disequilibrium and encourages the generator to synthesize adequate rather than
arbitrary frequency signals. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority and
effectiveness of our FreGAN in ameliorating generation quality in the low-data

While standard benchmarks are made available, a broader range of such data sets

theoretical works on axiomatization of clustering algorithms, especially axioms
on clustering preserving transformations are quite a cheap way to produce
labeled data sets from existing ones. However, the frequently cited axiomatic
system of Kleinberg:2002, as we show in this paper, is not applicable for
finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, in which many algorithms like $k$-means,
operate. In particular, the so-called outer-consistency axiom fails upon making
small changes in datapoint positions and inner-consistency axiom is valid only
for identity transformation in general settings.
  Hence we propose an alternative axiomatic system, in which Kleinberg's inner
consistency axiom is replaced by a centric consistency axiom and outer
consistency axiom is replaced by motion consistency axiom. We demonstrate that
the new system is satisfiable for a hierarchical version of $k$-means with
auto-adjusted $k$, hence it is not contradictory. Additionally, as $k$-means
creates convex clusters only, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a

ground-truth pose labels is generally time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Instead, we propose a label-free method that learns to enforce the geometric
consistency between category template mesh and observed object point cloud
under a self-supervision manner. Specifically, our method consists of three key
components: differentiable shape deformation, registration, and rendering. In
particular, shape deformation and registration are applied to the template mesh
to eliminate the differences in shape, pose and scale. A differentiable
renderer is then deployed to enforce geometric consistency between point clouds
lifted from the rendered depth and the observed scene for self-supervision. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and find that our approach
outperforms the simple traditional baseline by large margins while being

on a wide range of computer vision tasks. The progressive advances on this
topic have been made through the employment of the transformer framework with
the help of the multi-head attention mechanism. However, the attention-based
image patch interaction potentially suffers from problems of redundant
interactions of intra-class patches and unoriented interactions of inter-class

for image parsing to enable image patches to interact following a relation
reasoning pattern. Specifically, the linearly embedded image patches are first
projected into the graph space, where each node represents the implicit visual
center for a cluster of image patches and each edge reflects the relation
weight between two adjacent nodes. After that, global relation reasoning is
performed on this graph accordingly. Finally, all nodes including the relation
information are mapped back into the original space for subsequent processes.
Compared to the conventional transformer, GReaT has higher interaction
efficiency and a more purposeful interaction pattern. Experiments are carried

on the respective variables is obscure. Asking 'what qualifies an action for
being an intervention on the variable X' raises the question whether the action
impacted all other variables only through X or directly, which implicitly
refers to a causal model.
  To avoid this known circularity, we instead suggest a notion of
'phenomenological causality' whose basic concept is a set of elementary
actions. Then the causal structure is defined such that elementary actions
change only the causal mechanism at one node (e.g. one of the causal
conditionals in the Markov factorization). This way, the Principle of
Independent Mechanisms becomes the defining property of causal structure in
domains where causality is a more abstract phenomenon rather than being an
objective fact relying on hard-wired causal links between tangible objects. We

been accelerated by the advent of few-shot techniques such as chain of thought

models in a few-shot setup by augmenting the prompts with intermediate steps.
Despite impressive results across various tasks, the reasons behind their

develop a deeper understanding of CoT-based few-shot prompting mechanisms in

components of a prompt: symbols, patterns, and text. Then, we devise and

conventional wisdom around few-shot prompting. First, the presence of factual
patterns in a prompt is practically immaterial to the success of CoT. Second,
our results conclude that the primary role of intermediate steps may not be to
facilitate learning how to solve a task. The intermediate steps are rather a
beacon for the model to realize what symbols to replicate in the output to form
a factual answer. Further, text imbues patterns with commonsense knowledge and

information. Two important tasks related to the automatic extraction and
analysis of information in Microblogs are Entity Mention Detection (EMD) and
Entity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model the
non-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets.
They extract a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical,
and semantic -- from individual messages for noisy text modeling and entity
extraction. But given the constantly evolving nature of microblog streams,
detecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short
messages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named
EMD Globalizer, better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog
streams. It deviates from the processing of isolated microblog messages by
existing EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate context of a
message is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity
candidates by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining
to find additional candidate mentions that are missed during this first
detection. Aggregating the local contextual representations of these mentions,
a global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate
within a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities
within the candidates from false positives. All mentions of said entities from
the stream are produced in the framework's final outputs. Our experiments show
that EMD Globalizer can enhance the effectiveness of all existing EMD systems

trade-off exists between objectives. Key to solving such problems is to exploit
sparse dependency structures that exist between agents. For example, in wind
farm control a trade-off exists between maximising power and minimising stress
on the systems components. Dependencies between turbines arise due to the wake
effect. We model such sparse dependencies between agents as a multi-objective
coordination graph (MO-CoG). In multi-objective reinforcement learning a
utility function is typically used to model a users preferences over
objectives, which may be unknown a priori. In such settings a set of optimal
policies must be computed. Which policies are optimal depends on which
optimality criterion applies. If the utility function of a user is derived from
multiple executions of a policy, the scalarised expected returns (SER) must be
optimised. If the utility of a user is derived from a single execution of a
policy, the expected scalarised returns (ESR) criterion must be optimised. For
example, wind farms are subjected to constraints and regulations that must be
adhered to at all times, therefore the ESR criterion must be optimised. For
MO-CoGs, the state-of-the-art algorithms can only compute a set of optimal
policies for the SER criterion, leaving the ESR criterion understudied. To
compute a set of optimal polices under the ESR criterion, also known as the ESR

set of optimal policies under the ESR criterion for MO-CoGs, we present a novel
distributional multi-objective variable elimination (DMOVE) algorithm. We
evaluate DMOVE in realistic wind farm simulations. Given the returns in
real-world wind farm settings are continuous, we utilise a model known as

explicit examples sampled from the teacher models, further purified with three

considerably smaller, but better summarizers with sharper controllability. A
useful by-product of this iterative distillation process is a high-quality

Given the long lifespan of critical structures, this problem can be cast as a

Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a formal framework to solve
the underlying optimal planning task. However, two issues can undermine the
POMDP solutions. Firstly, the need for a model that can adequately describe the
evolution of the structural condition under deterioration or corrective actions
and, secondly, the non-trivial task of recovery of the observation process
parameters from available monitoring data. Despite these potential challenges,
the adopted POMDP models do not typically account for uncertainty on model
parameters, leading to solutions which can be unrealistically confident. In

transition and observation model parameters directly from available data, via
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

types. To defend different trigger types at once, we start from the
class-irrelevant nature of the poisoning process and propose a novel weakly
supervised backdoor defense framework WeDef. Recent advances in weak
supervision make it possible to train a reasonably accurate text classifier
using only a small number of user-provided, class-indicative seed words. Such
seed words shall be considered independent of the triggers. Therefore, a weakly
supervised text classifier trained by only the poisoned documents without their
labels will likely have no backdoor. Inspired by this observation, in WeDef, we
define the reliability of samples based on whether the predictions of the weak
classifier agree with their labels in the poisoned training set. We further
improve the results through a two-phase sanitization: (1) iteratively refine
the weak classifier based on the reliable samples and (2) train a binary poison
classifier by distinguishing the most unreliable samples from the most reliable
samples. Finally, we train the sanitized model on the samples that the poison
classifier predicts as benign. Extensive experiments show that WeDefis
effective against popular trigger-based attacks (e.g., words, sentences, and
paraphrases), outperforming existing defense methods.",https://github.com/LeshengJin/WeDef,4518

Gaussian to serve as a local point distribution for shape reconstruction. With
reconstruction losses accounted for at each hierarchy level and a decomposition
loss at each node, our network training does not require any ground-truth

Detectors have been greatly challenged by unnoticeable perturbation, with sharp
performance drop on clean images and extremely poor performance on adversarial
images. In this work, we empirically explore the model training for adversarial
robustness in object detection, which greatly attributes to the conflict
between learning clean images and adversarial images. To mitigate this issue,
we propose a Robust Detector (RobustDet) based on adversarially-aware
convolution to disentangle gradients for model learning on clean and

order is often a redundant cue in natural language. For example, the words
chopped, chef, and onion are more likely used to convey ""The chef chopped the

models to be surprisingly word order invariant, but crucially has largely
considered natural prototypical inputs, where compositional meaning mostly
matches lexical expectations. To overcome this confound, we probe grammatical
role representation in English BERT and GPT-2, on instances where lexical
expectations are not sufficient, and word order knowledge is necessary for
correct classification. Such non-prototypical instances are naturally occurring
English sentences with inanimate subjects or animate objects, or sentences
where we systematically swap the arguments to make sentences like ""The onion
chopped the chef"". We find that, while early layer embeddings are largely
lexical, word order is in fact crucial in defining the later-layer

of circuit elements necessary to achieve distinct depolarization,
hyperpolarization, and repolarization voltage waveforms. The proposed MSNN
uniquely implements STDP learning by using cumulative weight changes in
memristive synapses from the voltage waveform changes across the synapses,
which arise from the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking voltage signals

based on certain forms of Siamese networks. Such networks are conceptually
symmetric with two parallel encoders, but often practically asymmetric as
numerous mechanisms are devised to break the symmetry. In this work, we conduct
a formal study on the importance of asymmetry by explicitly distinguishing the
two encoders within the network -- one produces source encodings and the other
targets. Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than
source generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our
results from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs,
and is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline.
Moreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to
longer training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones.
Finally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a

environments that abstract real-world situations into a form where research can
be done conveniently. This paper contributes such an environment based on ideas
inspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce resources in a
spatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that
they prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing
behaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by
supply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where
the agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local
abundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then
discover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different
prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where
they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of
ablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards,
bartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods
can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work is

detection paradigm by eliminating a series of hand-crafted components. However,
DETR suffers from extremely slow convergence, which increases the training cost

Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR that greatly accelerates DETR's convergence
without sacrificing its accuracy. SAM-DETR addresses the convergence issue from
two perspectives. First, it projects object queries into the same embedding
space as encoded image features, where the matching can be accomplished
efficiently with aligned semantics. Second, it explicitly searches salient
points with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned matching,
which further speeds up the convergence and boosts detection accuracy as well.

poisoned training data, the adversary can embed a ""backdoor"" into the victim

a tree, we further adopt a graph neural network to guide the search over

used in real world NLP scenarios. NER research typically focuses on the
creation of new ways of training NER, with relatively less emphasis on
resources and evaluation. Further, state of the art (SOTA) NER models, trained
on standard datasets, typically report only a single performance measure
(F-score) and we don't really know how well they do for different entity types
and genres of text, or how robust are they to new, unseen entities. In this
paper, we perform a broad evaluation of NER using a popular dataset, that takes
into consideration various text genres and sources constituting the dataset at
hand. Additionally, we generate six new adversarial test sets through small
perturbations in the original test set, replacing select entities while
retaining the context. We also train and test our models on randomly generated
train/dev/test splits followed by an experiment where the models are trained on
a select set of genres but tested genres not seen in training. These
comprehensive evaluation strategies were performed using three SOTA NER models.

measuring linguistic biases against social groups such as ethnic minorities in
large text corpora. It does so by comparing the semantic relatedness of words
prototypical of the groups (e.g., names unique to those groups) and attribute

show that every one of these correlations is explained by a third variable: the
frequency of Black names in the underlying corpora relative to White names.
This occurs because word embeddings tend to group positive (negative) words and
frequent (rare) words together in the estimated semantic space. As the
frequency of Black names on social media is strongly correlated with Black
Americans' prevalence in the population, this results in spurious anti-Black
WEAT estimates wherever few Black Americans live. This suggests that research

make the intra-class samples more compact and the inter-class samples more

make our framework more robust to noisy data. Furthermore, CL-FEFA considers

faithful to the model that they explain, but faithfulness remains a rather
vague term. We revisit faithfulness in the context of continuous data and
propose two formal definitions of faithfulness for feature attribution methods.
Qualitative faithfulness demands that scores reflect the true qualitative
effect (positive vs. negative) of the feature on the model and quanitative
faithfulness that the magnitude of scores reflect the true quantitative effect.
We discuss under which conditions these requirements can be satisfied to which
extent (local vs global). As an application of the conceptual idea, we look at
differentiable classifiers over continuous data and characterize
Gradient-scores as follows: every qualitatively faithful feature attribution
method is qualitatively equivalent to Gradient-scores. Furthermore, if an
attribution method is quantitatively faithful in the sense that changes of the
output of the classifier are proportional to the scores of features, then it is
either equivalent to gradient-scoring or it is based on an inferior
approximation of the classifier. To illustrate the practical relevance of the
theory, we experimentally demonstrate that popular attribution methods can fail
to give faithful explanations in the setting where the data is continuous and

bidirectional context updates. Second, it is simplex-based, performing
diffusion on the natural vocabulary space rather than a learned latent space,
allowing us to incorporate classifier guidance and modular control using
off-the-shelf classifiers without any adaptation. We evaluate SSD-LM on
unconstrained text generation benchmarks, and show that it matches or

networks (DNNs). Lately, coresets (provable data summarizations) were leveraged

coresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under
restrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs. In real-world
scenarios, such assumptions are rarely satisfied, limiting the applicability of
coresets. To this end, we suggest a novel and robust framework for computing
such coresets under mild assumptions on the model's weights and without any

achieved by a combination of L\""{o}wner ellipsoid and Caratheodory theorem. Our

pre-training followed by fine-tuning or linear probing. Especially, selecting a
proper source domain for a specific target domain under predefined tasks is
crucial for improving efficiency and effectiveness. It is conventional to solve
this problem via estimating transferability. However, existing methods can not
reach a trade-off between performance and cost. To comprehensively evaluate
estimation methods, we summarize three properties: stability, reliability and
efficiency. Building upon them, we propose Principal Gradient Expectation(PGE),
a simple yet effective method for assessing transferability. Specifically, we
calculate the gradient over each weight unit multiple times with a restart
scheme, and then we compute the expectation of all gradients. Finally, the
transferability between the source and target is estimated by computing the gap
of normalized principal gradients. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
metric is superior to state-of-the-art methods on all properties.",None,-1

prohibitive adaptation costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a
colossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are
practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on
the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this
paper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes
a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched,
largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have
demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned
parameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter
fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In
this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then

that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a

theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to
error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap

our approach performs contrastive learning by directly sampling individual
point pairs from different regions. Compared to an aggregated representation

online knowledge distillation during training. Both advantages are important

in the context of scene understanding. Despite the growing progress on
benchmarks, we realize that existing methods often perform unsatisfactorily on

natural scene often involves multiple humans and objects with intricate spatial
relations, making the interaction recognition for distant human-object largely
affected by complex visual context. 2) Insufficient number of distant
interactions in benchmark datasets results in under-fitting on these instances.
To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method

component in our method is a novel Far Near Distance Attention module. It
enables information propagation between humans and objects, whereby the spatial
distance is skillfully taken into consideration. Besides, we devise a novel

We present a principled method to study this question. We pretrain BERT models
on joint corpora of Wikipedia and labeled downstream datasets, and fine-tune
them on the relevant task. Comparing performance between samples seen and
unseen during pretraining enables us to define and quantify levels of
memorization and exploitation. Experiments with two models and three downstream
tasks show that exploitation exists in some cases, but in others the models
memorize the contaminated data, but do not exploit it. We show that these two
measures are affected by different factors such as the number of duplications
of the contaminated data and the model size. Our results highlight the
importance of analyzing massive web-scale datasets to verify that progress in

to be an effective means for GAN-based face manipulation. The success of this

disentanglement. In this paper, we build on the StyleGAN generator, and present
a method that explicitly encourages face manipulation to focus on the intended

the original features and the modified ones. The guidance for the latent space
edits is achieved by employing CLIP, which has recently been shown to be
effective for text-driven edits. We perform extensive experiments and show that

through synthetic experiments that prompting a small number of AT's predictions
can promote one-shot non-autoregressive translation to achieve the equivalent
performance of IR-NAT. Following this line, we propose a new two-stage
translation prototype called hybrid-regressive translation (HRT). Specifically,
HRT first generates discontinuous sequences via autoregression (e.g., make a
prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills in all previously skipped tokens
at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to
effectively and efficiently train HRT without adding any model parameters. HRT

ablation studies indicate that Additive attention can actively learn to explain
the importance of its input hidden representations; (iii) when attention values
are nearly the same, the rank order of attention values is not consistent with
the rank order of the mutual information(iv) Using Gumbel-Softmax with a
temperature lower than one, tends to produce a more skewed attention score
distribution compared to softmax and hence is a better choice for explainable
design; (v) some building blocks are better at preserving the correlation
between the ordered list of mutual information and attention weights order (for

For example, in a medical setting a patient may only have one opportunity to
treat their illness. Making decisions using just the expected future returns --
known in reinforcement learning as the value -- cannot account for the
potential range of adverse or positive outcomes a decision may have. Therefore,
we should use the distribution over expected future returns differently to
represent the critical information that the agent requires at decision time by
taking both the future and accrued returns into consideration. In this paper,
we propose two novel Monte Carlo tree search algorithms. Firstly, we present a
Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that can compute policies for nonlinear
utility functions (NLU-MCTS) by optimising the utility of the different
possible returns attainable from individual policy executions, resulting in
good policies for both risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Secondly, we
propose a distributional Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (DMCTS) which
extends NLU-MCTS. DMCTS computes an approximate posterior distribution over the
utility of the returns, and utilises Thompson sampling during planning to
compute policies in risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Both algorithms
outperform the state-of-the-art in multi-objective reinforcement learning for
the expected utility of the returns.",None,-1

scalability and accuracy of detecting smaller Trojans in the presence of noise
and variations. To achieve high trigger coverage, AdaTest leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce a diverse set of test inputs.
Particularly, we progressively generate test vectors with high reward values in
an iterative manner. In each iteration, the test set is evaluated and
adaptively expanded as needed. Furthermore, AdaTest integrates adaptive
sampling to prioritize test samples that provide more information for HT
detection, thus reducing the number of samples while improving the sample
quality for faster exploration. We develop AdaTest with a Software/Hardware

AdaTest's architecture minimizes the hardware overhead in two ways:(i)
Deploying circuit emulation on programmable hardware to accelerate reward
evaluation of the test input; (ii) Pipelining each computation stage in AdaTest
by automatically constructing auxiliary circuit for test input generation,
reward evaluation, and adaptive sampling. We evaluate AdaTest's performance on
various HT benchmarks and compare it with two prior works that use logic

learning challenge for DSI to incrementally index new documents while being
able to answer queries related to both previously and newly indexed documents.
Across different model scales and document identifier representations, we show
that continual indexing of new documents leads to considerable forgetting of

mitigate these issues, we investigate two approaches. The first focuses on
modifying the training dynamics. Flatter minima implicitly alleviate

sequential decision-making. MDPs capture the stochasticity that may arise, for
instance, from imprecise actuators via probabilities in the transition
function. However, in data-driven applications, deriving precise probabilities
from (limited) data introduces statistical errors that may lead to unexpected
or undesirable outcomes. Uncertain MDPs (uMDPs) do not require precise
probabilities but instead use so-called uncertainty sets in the transitions,
accounting for such limited data. Tools from the formal verification community
efficiently compute robust policies that provably adhere to formal
specifications, like safety constraints, under the worst-case instance in the
uncertainty set. We continuously learn the transition probabilities of an MDP
in a robust anytime-learning approach that combines a dedicated Bayesian
inference scheme with the computation of robust policies. In particular, our
method (1) approximates probabilities as intervals, (2) adapts to new data that
may be inconsistent with an intermediate model, and (3) may be stopped at any
time to compute a robust policy on the uMDP that faithfully captures the data
so far. Furthermore, our method is capable of adapting to changes in the

First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some

Second, the representation's marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised

Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data,

learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard
distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue -- popular items are more
heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student

effectiveness of RS.
  In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD -- it roots in the
biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified

stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple
groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge
within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is

relying on a single source frame only, these methods lead to inaccurate

Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global
consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features.

far, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating
rule induction has been reported. This is first study to consider the
acceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We
propose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the
accelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a
rule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree,
called Consistence-based Value Reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis
to accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed Key Set,
which only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to
conduct value reduction. The monotonicity of Key Set ensures the feasibility of
our accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on Key
Set, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the
unaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of Key Set
ensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and
the unaccelerated method. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the

However, a natural question is ignored: can the hidden states be directly used
for classification without changing them? In this paper, we aim to answer this

English does not appear to make such distinctions. Using distributional
semantics, we show that English nominal pluralization exhibits semantic

another and less similar to pluralization of other semantic classes. Therefore,
reduction of the meaning shift in plural formation to the addition of an
abstract plural meaning is too simplistic. A semantically informed method,

distributional semantics which assume plural formation amounts to the addition
of a fixed plural vector. In comparison with our approach, a method from

to propose a unified model in the biomedical domain and use instructions to
achieve generalization across several biomedical tasks. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed model: 1) outperforms the single-task baseline by
~3% and multi-task (without instruction) baseline by ~18% on an average, and 2)
shows ~23% improvement compared to the single-task baseline in few-shot
learning (i.e., 32 instances per task) on an average. Our analysis indicates
that there is significant room for improvement across tasks in the BoX,

dynamic interspace by linear combinations of an underlying adaptive filter

Readers observe a new word and allocate time to process it as required. We
argue that prior results are also compatible with a reading process that is at
least partially anticipatory: Readers could make predictions about a future
word and allocate time to process it based on their expectation. In this work,
we operationalize this anticipation as a word's contextual entropy. We assess
the effect of anticipation on reading by comparing how well surprisal and
contextual entropy predict reading times on four naturalistic reading datasets:
two self-paced and two eye-tracking. Experimentally, across datasets and
analyses, we find substantial evidence for effects of contextual entropy over
surprisal on a word's reading time (RT): in fact, entropy is sometimes better
than surprisal in predicting a word's RT. Spillover effects, however, are
generally not captured by entropy, but only by surprisal. Further, we

first substantiate that indeed some examples are more difficult than others by
showing that different models consistently fail or succeed on the same test

test instance is hard if it contains a local structure that was not observed at
training time. We formulate a simple decision rule based on this criterion and
empirically show it predicts instance-level generalization well across 5
different semantic parsing datasets, substantially better than alternative

temporal information dynamics inside SNNs? How can we measure the temporal
information dynamics? How do the temporal information dynamics affect the
overall learning performance? To answer these questions, we estimate the Fisher
Information of the weights to measure the distribution of temporal information
during training in an empirical manner. Surprisingly, as training goes on,
Fisher information starts to concentrate in the early timesteps. After
training, we observe that information becomes highly concentrated in earlier

answers from a Knowledge Graph (KG) using natural language queries. The
challenge is to learn to reason over question-relevant KG facts that traverse
KG entities and lead to the question answers. To facilitate reasoning, the
question is decoded into instructions, which are dense question representations
used to guide the KG traversals. However, if the derived instructions do not
exactly match the underlying KG information, they may lead to reasoning under
irrelevant context. Our method, termed ReaRev, introduces a new way to KGQA
reasoning with respect to both instruction decoding and execution. To improve
instruction decoding, we perform reasoning in an adaptive manner, where
KG-aware information is used to iteratively update the initial instructions. To
improve instruction execution, we emulate breadth-first search (BFS) with graph
neural networks (GNNs). The BFS strategy treats the instructions as a set and
allows our method to decide on their execution order on the fly. Experimental

There are several challenges in realizing such a component in large-scale
reinforcement learning (RL) problems. One such challenge is dealing effectively
with continuous action spaces when using tree-search planning (e.g., it is not
feasible to consider every action even at just the root node of the tree). In
this paper we present a method for selecting affordances useful for planning --
for learning which small number of actions/options from a continuous space of
actions/options to consider in the tree-expansion process during planning. We
consider affordances that are goal-and-state-conditional mappings to
actions/options as well as unconditional affordances that simply select
actions/options available in all states. Our selection method is gradient
based: we compute gradients through the planning procedure to update the
parameters of the function that represents affordances. Our empirical work
shows that it is feasible to learn to select both primitive-action and option
affordances, and that simultaneously learning to select affordances and
planning with a learned value-equivalent model can outperform model-free RL.",None,-1

representation of large-scale signals. The key innovation in our multiscale
implicit neural representation (MINER) is an internal representation via a
Laplacian pyramid, which provides a sparse multiscale decomposition of the
signal that captures orthogonal parts of the signal across scales. We leverage
the advantages of the Laplacian pyramid by representing small disjoint patches
of the pyramid at each scale with a small MLP. This enables the capacity of the
network to adaptively increase from coarse to fine scales, and only represent
parts of the signal with strong signal energy. The parameters of each MLP are
optimized from coarse-to-fine scale which results in faster approximations at
coarser scales, thereby ultimately an extremely fast training process. We apply
MINER to a range of large-scale signal representation tasks, including
gigapixel images and very large point clouds, and demonstrate that it requires
fewer than 25% of the parameters, 33% of the memory footprint, and 10% of the
computation time of competing techniques such as ACORN to reach the same

with one or multiple metrics together with a way to aggregate different systems
performances. They are instrumental in (i) assessing the progress of new
methods along different axes and (ii) selecting the best systems for practical
use. This is particularly the case for NLP with the development of large
pre-trained models (e.g. GPT, BERT) that are expected to generalize well on a

is often reduced to a simple average over various performance measures.
However, this procedure can be problematic when the metrics are on a different

procedure to rank systems based on their performance across different tasks.
Motivated by the social choice theory, the final system ordering is obtained

neglect it and thus may have severe consequences, e.g., a robot may crash into
a glass wall. However, sensing the presence of glass is not straightforward.
The key challenge is that arbitrary objects/scenes can appear behind the glass.
In this paper, we propose an important problem of detecting glass surfaces from
a single RGB image. To address this problem, we construct the first large-scale
glass detection dataset (GDD) and propose a novel glass detection network,
called GDNet-B, which explores abundant contextual cues in a large
field-of-view via a novel large-field contextual feature integration (LCFI)
module and integrates both high-level and low-level boundary features with a
boundary feature enhancement (BFE) module. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our GDNet-B achieves satisfying glass detection results on the images
within and beyond the GDD testing set. We further validate the effectiveness
and generalization capability of our proposed GDNet-B by applying it to other
vision tasks, including mirror segmentation and salient object detection.
Finally, we show the potential applications of glass detection and discuss

descriptions according to rule of law, serves as legal assistance to mitigate
the great work burden of limited legal practitioners. Most existing methods
apply various large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) finetuned in LJP

irrelevant (or non-casual) information. The violation of rule of law not only
weakens the robustness and generalization ability of models but also results in
severe social problems like discrimination. In this paper, we use causal

target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is
widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence,
a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable
input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the
input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences
(called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of
which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always
uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by
vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides
practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC
alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra
functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this
work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the
desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the
BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the
paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the
paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields
models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using
BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved
performance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed
BRCTC reduces the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without

view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific

most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only

executable neuro-symbolic program by composing lexical meanings based on
syntax. The recovered meaning programs can be executed on grounded inputs. To
facilitate learning in an exponentially-growing compositional space, we
introduce a joint parsing and expected execution algorithm, which does local

vision for years. To tackle this challenging problem, numerous innovative
methods have been successively proposed and incorporating linguistic knowledge
into STR models has recently become a prominent trend. In this work, we first
draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT) to
construct a conceptually simple yet powerful vision STR model, which is built
upon ViT and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for scene text
recognition, including both pure vision models and language-augmented methods.
To integrate linguistic knowledge, we further propose a Multi-Granularity
Prediction strategy to inject information from the language modality into the
model in an implicit way, i.e. , subword representations (BPE and WordPiece)
widely-used in NLP are introduced into the output space, in addition to the
conventional character level representation, while no independent language
model (LM) is adopted. The resultant algorithm (termed MGP-STR) is able to push
the performance envelop of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, it
achieves an average recognition accuracy of 93.35% on standard benchmarks. Code

of the core tasks in natural language processing. However, maximization-based
decoding methods (e.g., greedy/beam search) often lead to the degeneration
problem, i.e., the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable
repetitions. Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness
prone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra
computational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation
from a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a
directed graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as
circular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose
a novel decoding method -- \textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the
LM to \textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph. Meanwhile,
it also allows the LM to return to the existing nodes with a momentum
downgraded by a pre-defined resistance function. We extensively test our
approach on three benchmarks from different domains through automatic and human
evaluations. The results show that momentum decoding performs comparably with
the current state of the art while enjoying notably improved inference speed

analogical MWP pairs in a latent space, i.e., encoding an MWP close to another
analogical MWP, while moving away from the non-analogical ones. Moreover, a
solution discriminator is integrated into the MWP solver to enhance the
association between the representations of MWPs and their true solutions. The
evaluation results verify that our proposed analogical learning strategy
promotes the performance of MWP-BERT on Math23k over the state-of-the-art model

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, namely Characteristic

scratchpads. They perform better when prompted with informative instructions,
and they acquire new reasoning capabilities by generating a scratch-pad before
predicting the final answers. However, they do not \textit{internalize} these
performance gains, which disappear when the context tokens are gone. Our work
proposes to apply context distillation so that a language model can improve
itself by internalizing these gains. Concretely, given a synthetic unlabeled
input for the target task, we condition the model on ``[instructions] +
[task-input]'' to predict ``[scratch-pad] + [final answer]''; then we fine-tune
the same model to predict its own ``[final answer]'' conditioned on the
``[task-input]'', without seeing the ``[instructions]'' or using the
``[scratch-pad]''.
  We show that context distillation is a general method to train language
models, and it can effectively internalize 3 types of training signals. First,
it can internalize abstract task instructions and explanations, so we can
iteratively update the model parameters with new instructions and overwrite old
ones. Second, it can internalize step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
(e.g., 8-digit addition), and such a newly acquired capability proves to be
useful for other downstream tasks. Finally, it can internalize concrete
training examples, and it outperforms directly learning with gradient descent
by 9\% on the SPIDER Text-to-SQL dataset; furthermore, combining context
distillation operations can internalize more training examples than the context
window size allows.",None,38020

various computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose the first
method using a Dual-Pixel (DP) sensor to better address the raindrop removal.
Our key observation is that raindrops attached to a glass window yield
noticeable disparities in DP's left-half and right-half images, while almost no
disparity exists for in-focus backgrounds. Therefore, DP disparities can be
utilized for robust raindrop detection. The DP disparities also brings the
advantage that the occluded background regions by raindrops are shifted between
the left-half and the right-half images. Therefore, fusing the information from
the left-half and the right-half images can lead to more accurate background
texture recovery. Based on the above motivation, we propose a DP Raindrop
Removal Network (DPRRN) consisting of DP raindrop detection and DP fused
raindrop removal. To efficiently generate a large amount of training data, we
also propose a novel pipeline to add synthetic raindrops to real-world
background DP images. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets

propose query-independent (Unary) and query-dependent (Pairwise) components to
facilitate the learning of both terms. In contrast to the SA, the UPA ensures
query dependence via operating locally. Extensive experiments show that the UPA
outperforms the SA consistently on various point cloud understanding tasks

Moreover, simply equipping the popular PointNet++ method with the UPA even

valuable confusing samples would compromise the model generalisation while
using them for training would exacerbate the confirmation bias issue caused by
inevitable mislabelling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use
confusing samples proactively without label correction. Specifically, a virtual
category (VC) is assigned to each confusing sample such that they can safely
contribute to the model optimisation even without a concrete label. It is
attributed to specifying the embedding distance between the training sample and
the virtual category as the lower bound of the inter-class distance. Moreover,
we also modify the localisation loss to allow high-quality boundaries for
location regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VC
learning significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art, especially with small
amounts of available labels.",https://github.com/GeoffreyChen777/VC,-1

that the poetic style of the Heroides is Ovidian, but distinctive; they can be
accurately isolated from Ovid more broadly. The Single and Double Heroides
split into two clear groups, with the ES grouped consistently with the single
letters. Furthermore, by comparing the style of the letters with the 'early'

adequately covers the state space -- play a fundamental role in determining the
sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning. While such conditions
might seem irrelevant to online reinforcement learning at first glance, we
establish a new connection by showing -- somewhat surprisingly -- that the mere
existence of a data distribution with good coverage can enable sample-efficient
online RL. Concretely, we show that coverability -- that is, existence of a
data distribution that satisfies a ubiquitous coverage condition called
concentrability -- can be viewed as a structural property of the underlying
MDP, and can be exploited by standard algorithms for sample-efficient
exploration, even when the agent does not know said distribution. We complement
this result by proving that several weaker notions of coverage, despite being
sufficient for offline RL, are insufficient for online RL. We also show that
existing complexity measures for online RL, including Bellman rank and
Bellman-Eluder dimension, fail to optimally capture coverability, and propose a
new complexity measure, the sequential extrapolation coefficient, to provide a
unification.",None,-1

(KGs), are naturally incomplete. Since scientific and industrial applications
have extensively adopted them, there is a high demand for solutions that
complete their information. Several recent works tackle this challenge by
learning embeddings for entities and relations, then employing them to predict
new relations among the entities. Despite their aggrandizement, most of those
methods focus only on the local neighbors of a relation to learn the
embeddings. As a result, they may fail to capture the KGs' context information
by neglecting long-term dependencies and the propagation of entities'
semantics. In this manuscript, we propose {\AE}MP (Attention-based Embeddings
from Multiple Patterns), a novel model for learning contextualized
representations by: (i) acquiring entities' context information through an
attention-enhanced message-passing scheme, which captures the entities' local
semantics while focusing on different aspects of their neighborhood; and (ii)
capturing the semantic context, by leveraging the paths and their relationships
between entities. Our empirical findings draw insights into how attention
mechanisms can improve entities' context representation and how combining
entities and semantic path contexts improves the general representation of
entities and the relation predictions. Experimental results on several large

series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the

information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the
attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and
the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series
Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy
significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also

impedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question
is whether we can find some substitute of the current attention which is more
stable and could keep the most important characteristics on explanation and
prediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a
first rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable
Attention). Specifically, a SEAT should has the following three properties: (1)
Its prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based
on the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-k indices have large overlaps with those
of the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any
slight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too
much, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and
perturbations. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we
compare our SEAT with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM and BERT

AIs can surpass human performance by a large margin. Given that the state space
of Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal
state, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to
play surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of
adversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are
``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves
to the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an
undoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However,
searching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and
non-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first
adversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states
by strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to
other board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken
by both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)

which can effectively penalize unlikely predictions. In specific, we present an
inverse reinforcement learning based multi-modal trajectory distribution
forecasting framework that learns to plan by an approximate value iteration

inefficient as it always yields an entirely new model for each task. Currently,
many research works propose to only fine-tune a small portion of the parameters
while keeping most of the parameters shared across different tasks. These
methods achieve surprisingly good performance and are shown to be more stable
than their corresponding fully fine-tuned counterparts. However, such kind of
methods is still not well understood. Some natural questions arise: How does
the parameter sparsity lead to promising performance? Why is the model more
stable than the fully fine-tuned models? How to choose the tunable parameters?
In this paper, we first categorize the existing methods into random approaches,
rule-based approaches, and projection-based approaches based on how they choose
which parameters to tune. Then, we show that all of the methods are actually
sparse fine-tuned models and conduct a novel theoretical analysis of them. We
indicate that the sparsity is actually imposing a regularization on the
original model by controlling the upper bound of the stability. Such stability
leads to better generalization capability which has been empirically observed
in a lot of recent research works. Despite the effectiveness of sparsity
grounded by our theory, it still remains an open problem of how to choose the

minimize a weighted sum of service delay and resource consumption cost, which

subtasks: placement subtask and routing subtask. Each subtask consists of
multiple concurrent parallel sequential decision processes. By invoking the
deep deterministic policy gradient method and multi-agent technique, an
MADRL-P&R framework is designed to perform the two subtasks. The new joint
reward and internal rewards mechanism is proposed to match the goals and

planning research. A key part is the representation of action models. Decades
of advances improving declarative action model representations resulted in
numerous theoretical advances, and capable, working, domain-independent
planners. However, despite the maturity of the field, AI planning technology is
still rarely used outside the research community, suggesting that current
representations fail to capture real-world requirements, such as utilizing
complex mathematical functions and models learned from data. We argue that this
is because the modeling process is assumed to have taken place and completed
prior to the planning process, i.e., offline modeling for offline planning.
There are several challenges inherent to this approach, including: limited
expressiveness of declarative modeling languages; early commitment to modeling
choices and computation, that preclude using the most appropriate resolution
for each action model -- which can only be known during planning; and
difficulty in reliably using non-declarative, learned, models.
  We therefore suggest to change the AI planning process, such that is carries
out online modeling in offline planning, i.e., the use of action models that
are computed or even generated as part of the planning process, as they are
accessed. This generalizes the existing approach (offline modeling). The
proposed definition admits novel planning processes, and we suggest one
concrete implementation, demonstrating the approach. We sketch initial results

are obtained via the use of equivariant models. We recognise that
compositional, or part-whole structure is also an important aspect of images
that has to be considered for building transformation-robust models. Thus, we
propose a capsule network model that is, at once, equivariant and
compositionality-aware. Equivariance of our capsule network model comes from
the use of equivariant convolutions in a carefully-chosen novel architecture.
The awareness of compositionality comes from the use of our proposed novel,
iterative, graph-based routing algorithm, termed Iterative collaborative
routing (ICR). ICR, the core of our contribution, weights the predictions made
for capsules based on an iteratively averaged score of the degree-centralities

achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get
stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding
algorithms (\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive
since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora
(e.g., 0.02\% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for
generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship
between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous
repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that
1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The
sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more
times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of
continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial
probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by
our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO}
(Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion
Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize
probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data.
Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show
that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing
perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments
on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization
(CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method.",https://github.com/Jxu-Thu/DITTO,-1

level generation in games. Its key advantage is that it is generic and able to
satisfy functional constraints. However, due to the heavy computational costs
to run these algorithms online, search-based PCG is rarely utilized for
real-time generation. In this paper, we introduce mutation models, a new type
of iterative level generator based on machine learning. We train a model to
imitate the evolutionary process and use the trained model to generate levels.
This trained model is able to modify noisy levels sequentially to create better
levels without the need for a fitness function during inference. We evaluate
our trained models on a 2D maze generation task. We compare several different
versions of the method: training the models either at the end of evolution
(normal evolution) or every 100 generations (assisted evolution) and using the
model as a mutation function during evolution. Using the assisted evolution
process, the final trained models are able to generate mazes with a success
rate of 99% and high diversity of 86%. The trained model is many times faster
than the evolutionary process it was trained on. This work opens the door to a
new way of learning level generators guided by an evolutionary process, meaning

intersection areas of multiple attribute distributions as their combination for
generation. Our method first estimates the attribute space with an autoencoder
structure. Afterward, we iteratively approach the intersections by jointly
minimizing distances to points representing different attributes. Finally, we
map them to attribute-relevant sentences with a prefix-tuning-based decoder.

polyphone disambiguation models are trained on manually annotated datasets, and
publicly available datasets for polyphone disambiguation are scarce. In this
paper we propose a simple back-translation-style data augmentation method for
mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation, utilizing a large amount of
unlabeled text data. Inspired by the back-translation technique proposed in the
field of machine translation, we build a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) model to
predict the pronunciation of polyphonic character, and a Phoneme-to-Grapheme
(P2G) model to predict pronunciation into text. Meanwhile, a window-based
matching strategy and a multi-model scoring strategy are proposed to judge the
correctness of the pseudo-label. We design a data balance strategy to improve
the accuracy of some typical polyphonic characters in the training set with
imbalanced distribution or data scarcity. The experimental result shows the
effectiveness of the proposed back-translation-style data augmentation method.",None,-1

Previous studies focused on approximating the distribution of normal features

between the LM and the KG. To address these issues, we propose Question
Answering Transformer (QAT), which is designed to jointly reason over language

QAT constructs Meta-Path tokens, which learn relation-centric embeddings based

Self-Attention module comprehensively integrates different modalities via the
Cross-Modal Relative Position Bias, which guides information exchange between
relevant entites of different modalities. We validate the effectiveness of QAT

disentangle encoded features into multiple frequency components and perform
low-frequency skip connections to preserve outline and structural information.
Then we alleviate the generator's struggles of synthesizing fine details by
employing high-frequency skip connections, thus providing informative frequency

challenge the dense encoder and 2) a pair-wise rank-consistent regularization
to make dense model's behavior incline to the other. We evaluate our model on
three public benchmarks, which shows that with a comparable lexicon-aware

been lacking in a rigorous quantitative assessment of such systems because
these real-world data distributions are complex and unknown. In this work, we

active research topics in computer vision and image processing. Conventionally,
these two topics have been studied separately using independent imaging setups
and there is no existing method which can acquire depth and spectral
reflectance simultaneously in one shot without using special hardware. In this
paper, we propose a novel single-shot hyperspectral-depth reconstruction method

single color-dot projection, which simultaneously acts as structured light for
depth reconstruction and spatially-varying color illuminations for
hyperspectral reflectance reconstruction. To jointly reconstruct the depth and
the hyperspectral reflectance from a single color-dot image, we propose a novel
end-to-end network architecture that effectively incorporates a geometric
color-dot pattern loss and a photometric hyperspectral reflectance loss.
Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our hyperspectral-depth

an essential video processing technique that can be applied to various
scenarios. However, most existing methods cannot handle small objects or large
motion well, especially in high-resolution videos such as 4K videos. To
eliminate such limitations, we introduce a neighbor correspondence matching
(NCM) algorithm for flow-based frame synthesis. Since the current frame is not
available in video frame synthesis, NCM is performed in a
current-frame-agnostic fashion to establish multi-scale correspondences in the
spatial-temporal neighborhoods of each pixel. Based on the powerful motion
representation capability of NCM, we further propose to estimate intermediate
flows for frame synthesis in a heterogeneous coarse-to-fine scheme.
Specifically, the coarse-scale module is designed to leverage neighbor
correspondences to capture large motion, while the fine-scale module is more
computationally efficient to speed up the estimation process. Both modules are
trained progressively to eliminate the resolution gap between training dataset
and real-world videos. Experimental results show that NCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. In addition, NCM can be
applied to various practical scenarios such as video compression to achieve
better performance.",None,-1

Our motive comes from the recent advances in supermask training which shows
that high-performing sparse subnetworks can be located by simply updating mask

deviation of the larger variants, such as underpredicting reading times of

The interference of underwater creature characteristics on object

dehazing, has been of significant interest for various computer vision
applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved
success. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the
hierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their
relationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method
named Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion
and contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing
network (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically,
the core design in the HDN is a hierarchical interaction module, which utilizes
multi-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To
cooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive
learning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal.

and automatic report generation can play an important role in intra-operative
guidance, decision-making and postoperative analysis in robotic surgery.
However, domain shifts between different surgeries with inter and intra-patient
variation and novel instruments' appearance degrade the performance of model
prediction. Moreover, it requires output from multiple models, which can be
computationally expensive and affect real-time performance.
  Methodology: A multi-task learning (MTL) model is proposed for surgical
report generation and tool-tissue interaction prediction that deals with domain
shift problems. The model forms of shared feature extractor, mesh-transformer
branch for captioning and graph attention branch for tool-tissue interaction
prediction. The shared feature extractor employs class incremental contrastive
learning (CICL) to tackle intensity shift and novel class appearance in the
target domain. We design Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) based curriculum learning
into both shared and task-specific branches to enhance model learning. We
incorporate a task-aware asynchronous MTL optimization technique to fine-tune
the shared weights and converge both tasks optimally.
  Results: The proposed MTL model trained using task-aware optimization and
fine-tuning techniques reported a balanced performance (BLEU score of 0.4049
for scene captioning and accuracy of 0.3508 for interaction detection) for both
tasks on the target domain and performed on-par with single-task models in
domain adaptation.

individuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past
news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made,
existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in
the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability
to future data. For example, 97\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the
entity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to
merely 33\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to
hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about
`Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an
entity debiasing framework (\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news
detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a
cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news
contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause
(entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the
direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline
experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed
framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and
online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake
news detection models to the future data. The code has been released at

AF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and
then aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform
document-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the

task-relevant information and is invariant to domain specifics. This step

networks in computer vision. When the two methods perform the same, SGD is
preferable because it uses less memory (12 bytes/parameter with momentum and 8
bytes/parameter without) than AdamW (16 bytes/parameter). However, on a suite
of downstream tasks, especially those with distribution shifts, we find that
fine-tuning with AdamW performs substantially better than SGD on modern Vision
Transformer and ConvNeXt models. We find that large gaps in performance between
SGD and AdamW occur when the fine-tuning gradients in the first ""embedding""
layer are much larger than in the rest of the model. Our analysis suggests an
easy fix that works consistently across datasets and models: freezing the
embedding layer (less than 1% of the parameters) leads to SGD with or without
momentum performing slightly better than AdamW while using less memory (e.g.,
on ViT-L, SGD uses 33% less GPU memory). Our insights result in
state-of-the-art accuracies on five popular distribution shift benchmarks:

improve efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE
adopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated
convolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces
the computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the
satisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging
framework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to
accelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then
utilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher
tagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results
demonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance,

generalization over unseen tasks. Yet imperceptible adversarial perturbations
can significantly reduce CLIP's performance on new tasks. In this work, we
identify and explore the problem of \emph{adapting large-scale models for

model adaption -- training losses and adaptation methods -- that affect the
model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We then propose a text-guided
contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the
adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of
training data. We apply this training loss to two adaption methods, model
finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more
effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of
text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot
adversarial robustness over CLIP, seeing an average improvement of over 31

several facets of society ranging from politics, research, and commercial

task-level prompting and instance-level prompting. Task-level prompting methods
learn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient but

Instance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, though

promising solution. Both learning methods attempt to alleviate the dependency
of deep networks on the requirement of large-scale labeled data. Although
self-supervised methods have recently advanced dramatically, their utility on
CDFSL is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the role of
self-supervised representation learning in the context of CDFSL via a thorough
evaluation of existing methods. It comes as a surprise that even with shallow
architectures or small training datasets, self-supervised methods can perform
favorably compared to the existing SOTA methods. Nevertheless, no single
self-supervised approach dominates all datasets indicating that existing
self-supervised methods are not universally applicable. In addition, we find
that representations extracted from self-supervised methods exhibit stronger
robustness than the supervised method. Intriguingly, whether self-supervised
representations perform well on the source domain has little correlation with
their applicability on the target domain. As part of our study, we conduct an
objective measurement of the performance for six kinds of representative
classifiers. The results suggest Prototypical Classifier as the standard
evaluation recipe for CDFSL.",None,-1

combining IBL with translational models. Experiments on various tasks confirmed
the IBL model's effectiveness and interpretability.
  In addition, IBL shed light on the mechanism of rule-based KBC models.
Previous research has generally agreed that rule-based models provide rules
with semantically compatible premises and hypotheses. We challenge this view.
We begin by demonstrating that some logical rules represent {\it instance-based
equivalence} (i.e. prototypes) rather than semantic compatibility. These are
denoted as {\it IBL rules}. Surprisingly, despite occupying only a small
portion of the rule space, IBL rules outperform non-IBL rules in all four
benchmarks. We use a variety of experiments to demonstrate that rule-based
models work because they have the ability to represent instance-based
equivalence via IBL rules. The findings provide new insights of how rule-based
models work and how to interpret their rules.",https://github.com/chenxran/InstanceBasedLearning,-1

structure to learn well-factorized causal representations. In contrast,
traditional neural networks suffer from forgetting in changing environments and

Inspired by the brain thalamocortical circuit, we introduce a simple algorithm
that uses optimization at inference time to generate internal representations
of the current task dynamically. The algorithm alternates between updating the
model weights and a latent task embedding, allowing the agent to parse the
stream of temporal experience into discrete events and organize learning about
them. On a continual learning benchmark, it achieves competitive end average
accuracy by mitigating forgetting, but importantly, by requiring the model to
adapt through latent updates, it organizes knowledge into flexible structures
with a cognitive interface to control them. Tasks later in the sequence can be
solved through knowledge transfer as they become reachable within the
well-factorized latent space. The algorithm meets many of the desiderata of an
ideal continually learning agent in open-ended environments, and its simplicity
suggests fundamental computations in circuits with abundant feedback control

manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. Research efforts have been
made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social

that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be
crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In
addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are
constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute
their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater
inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more
attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot
detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency.
Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social

exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the
stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic
consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the

embeds the identity information into the carrier imperceptibly. Then the
identity can be extracted to prove the copyright from the watermarked carrier

technologies take the nature images as carriers. Different from the natural
images, document images are not so rich in color and texture, and thus have
less redundant information to carry watermarks. This paper proposes an
end-to-end document image watermarking scheme using the deep neural network.
Specifically, an encoder and a decoder are designed to embed and extract the
watermark. A noise layer is added to simulate the various attacks that could be
encountered in reality, such as the Cropout, Dropout, Gaussian blur, Gaussian
noise, Resize, and JPEG Compression. A text-sensitive loss function is designed
to limit the embedding modification on characters. An embedding strength
adjustment strategy is proposed to improve the quality of watermarked image
with little loss of extraction accuracy. Experimental results show that the
proposed document image watermarking technology outperforms three

representation. However, such Chinese character representation will suffer two
bottlenecks: 1) Learning bottleneck, the learning cannot benefit from its rich

break the bottlenecks, namely StrokeNet, which represents a Chinese character
by a Latinized stroke sequence (e.g., ""ao1 (concave)"" to ""ajaie"" and ""tu1

the lack of paired audio and textual data with semantic annotation. In this

The idea is that when the model is not highly confident, it is difficult to

have high attribution scores for any class and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on six datasets with two popular pre-trained language models in the

sentence-level relation extraction (RE), but this risks leaking superficial and

entity mentions to prevent the RE models from overfitting entity mentions.
However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the

probabilities to output sequences that are repetitive, incoherent, or

model for English that scores model generations given a prefix. RankGen can be
flexibly incorporated as a scoring function in beam search and used to decode

contrastive learning to map a prefix close to the ground-truth sequence that
follows it and far away from two types of negatives: (1) random sequences from
the same document as the prefix, and (2) sequences generated from a large
language model conditioned on the prefix. Experiments across four different
language models (345M-11B parameters) and two domains show that RankGen
significantly outperforms decoding algorithms like nucleus, top-k, and typical
sampling, as well as contrastive decoding and search, on both automatic metrics
(85.0 vs 77.3 MAUVE over nucleus) as well as human evaluations with English

surprisingly, a weak snapshot ensemble of several intermediate models from a

respond to trip requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard
combinatorial and sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. To
avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term,
vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility
function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility
function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be
performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when
applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch
paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the
environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g.,
traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become
stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve
the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic
trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by
construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our
problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP
as a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate
actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while
optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging;
indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice.
To tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to

replaced token detection and replaced token denoising. Specifically, given
masked source sentences, the generator outputs the target distribution and the
discriminator predicts whether the target sampled tokens from distribution are
incorrect. The target sentence is replaced with misclassified tokens to
construct noisy previous context, which is used to generate the gold sentence.
In general, both tasks improve the ability of language understanding and

vehicle (UAV). We treat UAV-user link channel model parameters and antenna
radiation pattern of the UAV as unknowns that need to be estimated. A hybrid
channel model is proposed that consists of a traditional path loss model
combined with a neural network approximating the UAV antenna gain function.
With this model and a set of offline RSS measurements, the unknown parameters
are estimated. We then employ the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique
which utilizes the learned hybrid channel model along with a 3D map of the
environment to accurately localize the ground users. The performance of the
developed algorithm is evaluated through simulations and also real-world

explanation methods, such as gradient-based or Shapley value-based methods,
provide measures of importance which are well-understood mathematically. But
how does a person receiving the explanation (the explainee) comprehend it? And
does their understanding match what the explanation attempted to communicate?
We empirically investigate the effect of various factors of the input, the
feature-attribution explanation, and visualization procedure, on laypeople's
interpretation of the explanation. We query crowdworkers for their
interpretation on tasks in English and German, and fit a GAMM model to their
responses considering the factors of interest. We find that people often
mis-interpret the explanations: superficial and unrelated factors, such as word
length, influence the explainees' importance assignment despite the explanation
communicating importance directly. We then show that some of this distortion

document classification and entity recognition. We find that for common NLP

fast models that have learned by observing a deep learning model. This allows
us to reduce the compute cost of large-scale classification jobs by more than

Self-Correction, an approach that decouples an imperfect base generator (an

language model edits on naturally occurring data results in diverse

optimizing a complex objective similarity function, leading to long run times.
This contributes to a convention for aligning all data to a global average
reference frame that poorly reflects the underlying cortical heterogeneity. In
this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based framework that
converts registration to a multi-label classification problem, where each point
in a low-resolution control grid deforms to one of fixed, finite number of

range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level,
given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the
sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these
models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of
downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between
the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to
obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific
tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which
may still require ad-hoc interaction.
  Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).
LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive
combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows
constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy
adaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing
high-level semantics.
  To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language),
which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate
an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls
to the underlying language model.
  We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting
methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are
challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows
that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also
significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case
of pay-to-use APIs (26-85% cost savings).",https://github.com/eth-sri/lmql,-1

information about themselves. While the action of sharing is simple, it
requires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to
share, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to
be shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal
assistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and
recommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content
that a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and
highly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not
address these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant
should be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering
that user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be
able to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make
the decision on her own. Accordingly, this paper proposes a personal assistant
that uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy
label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can
model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not
know the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty
is high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk
factors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its
recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a
well-known data set. Our results show that our personal assistant can
accurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and

In this work, we attempt to learn more about these processes by examining the

information (MI) of instances and their representations with a low-bias MI
estimator to perform self-supervised pre-training. Rather than supervised
pre-training focusing on the discriminable features of the seen classes, our
self-supervised model has less bias toward the seen classes, resulting in
better generalization for unseen classes. We explain that supervised
pre-training and self-supervised pre-training are actually maximizing different
MI objectives. Extensive experiments are further conducted to analyze their FSL
performance with various training settings. Surprisingly, the results show that
self-supervised pre-training can outperform supervised pre-training under the

attracted tons of attentions recently from both industry and academia.
Different from the conventional feature-based explanations (e.g.,
attributions), counterfactuals are a series of hypothetical samples which can
flip model decisions with minimal perturbations on queries. Given valid
counterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under ``what-if''
circumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries.
However, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may
unintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about
higher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in
this paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private
counterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set,
where noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation
roles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the
functional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the
DPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of
differential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the

intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing
a detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be
tempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user. However, in most

three main components: (1) The condition of rebuttal that the reasoning node
can be challenged; (2) Logical formulae that uncover the internal texture of
reasoning nodes; (3) Reasoning strength indicated by degrees of certainty. The
fine-grained structure conforms to the real logical reasoning scenario, better
fitting the human cognitive process but, simultaneously, is more challenging

detection and semantic segmentation, by leveraging the temporal redundancies

learns the variations in the teacher's intermediate features over time. We
demonstrate that these temporal variations can be effectively distilled due to
the temporal redundancies within video frames. During inference, both teacher
and student cooperate for providing predictions: the former by providing
initial representations extracted only on the key-frame, and the latter by
iteratively estimating and applying deltas for the successive frames. Moreover,
we consider various design choices to learn optimal student architectures
including an end-to-end learnable architecture search. By extensive experiments
on a wide range of architectures, including the most efficient ones, we
demonstrate that delta distillation sets a new state of the art in terms of

inducing better few-shot performance while they still follow a parametric-based
learning paradigm; the oblivion and rote memorization problems in learning may
encounter unstable generalization issues. Specifically, vanilla prompt learning
may struggle to utilize atypical instances by rote during fully-supervised
training or overfit shallow patterns with low-shot data. To alleviate such
limitations, we develop RetroPrompt with the motivation of decoupling knowledge
from memorization to help the model strike a balance between generalization and
memorization. In contrast with vanilla prompt learning, RetroPrompt constructs
an open-book knowledge-store from training instances and implements a retrieval
mechanism during the process of input, training and inference, thus equipping
the model with the ability to retrieve related contexts from the training
corpus as cues for enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RetroPrompt can obtain better performance in both few-shot and zero-shot
settings. Besides, we further illustrate that our proposed RetroPrompt can
yield better generalization abilities with new datasets. Detailed analysis of
memorization indeed reveals RetroPrompt can reduce the reliance of language
models on memorization; thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks.

predictors. To this end, we propose \emph{DiffPose}, a conditional diffusion

the (one-problem; one-solution) pairs, each of which is made of a problem
description and a solution showing reasoning flow to get the correct answer.
However, one MWP problem naturally has multiple solution equations. The
training of an MWP solver with (one-problem; one-solution) pairs excludes other
correct solutions, and thus limits the generalizability of the MWP solver. One
feasible solution to this limitation is to augment multiple solutions to a
given problem. However, it is difficult to collect diverse and accurate augment
solutions through human efforts. In this paper, we design a new training
framework for an MWP solver by introducing a solution buffer and a solution
discriminator. The buffer includes solutions generated by an MWP solver to
encourage the training data diversity. The discriminator controls the quality
of buffered solutions to participate in training. Our framework is flexibly
applicable to a wide setting of fully, semi-weakly and weakly supervised

Theoretically, we propose a light-weighted Expectation-Correction (EC)

approaches including the cosine similarity of Additively Composed (AC) sentence

the Recursive Optimal Transport Similarity (ROTS) algorithm to capture the
compositional phrase semantics by composing multiple recursive EC formulations.
ROTS finishes in linear time and is faster than its predecessors. ROTS is

work, we propose to train a generative model incorporating a triplet loss that
acknowledges the degree of dissimilarity between classes and reflects them in
the generated samples. Moreover, a cyclic-consistency loss is also enforced to
ensure that generated visual samples of a class highly correspond to their own
semantics. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ZSD datasets - MSCOCO and
PASCAL-VOC - demonstrate significant gains over the current ZSD methods,
reducing semantic confusion and improving detection for the unseen classes.",https://github.com/sandipan211/ZSD-SC-Resolver,-1

representing the subgoal structure of instances drawn from the same domain.
Sketches are collections of rules of the form C -> E over a given set of

satisfies C to a state that achieves the change expressed by E or a goal state.
Sketches can encode simple goal serializations, general policies, or
decompositions of bounded width that can be solved greedily, in polynomial
time, by the SIW_R variant of the SIW algorithm. Previous work has shown the
computational value of sketches over benchmark domains that, while tractable,
are challenging for domain-independent planners. In this work, we address the
problem of learning sketches automatically given a planning domain, some
instances of the target class of problems, and the desired bound on the sketch

usually follow a two-step strategy: 1) constructing text graphs based on
various views (\textit{co-user}, \textit{co-entities} and

specific GNN model. Generally, the results heavily rely on the quality of the
constructed graphs and the specific message passing scheme. However, existing

information induced by unreliable views. 2) Temporal information which works as
a vital indicator of events is neglected in most works. To this end, we propose
ETGNN, a novel Evidential Temporal-aware Graph Neural Network. Specifically, we
construct view-specific graphs whose nodes are the texts and edges are

signal data, we create a small set of features, which can be used to classify
PDs with high accuracy. This set of features consists of the total magnitude,
the maximum magnitude, and the length of the longest empty band. These features
represent the entire signal and not just a single phase, so the feature set has
a fixed size and is easily comprehensible. With both Random Forest and SVM
classification methods, we attain a 99% classification accuracy, which is
significantly higher than classification using phase based feature sets such as

the amplification of biases encoded by the models. In this work, we assess the

(MTR) framework that models motion prediction as the joint optimization of
global intention localization and local movement refinement. Instead of using
goal candidates, MTR incorporates spatial intention priors by adopting a small
set of learnable motion query pairs. Each motion query pair takes charge of
trajectory prediction and refinement for a specific motion mode, which
stabilizes the training process and facilitates better multimodal predictions.
Experiments show that MTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the

To further enhance the accuracy of knowledge graph completion we propose to

in the normal models, which are only activated when the model is aware of the
specific inputs (i.e., the trigger). However, despite their success in the
conventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on
graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which
is specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the
discreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while
retaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To
address such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor
is activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve
the model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus,
when the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under
these settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the
trigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution
Backdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can
be viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of
GCNs. (2) Variants of existing graph attacks. We extend current gradient-based
attack methods to our backdoor attack scenario. Extensive experiments on two

of idiomatic expressions, such as ""under the weather"". The meaning of these
expressions is not composed by the meaning of their constituent words, and NMT
models tend to translate them literally (i.e., word-by-word), which leads to
confusing and nonsensical translations. Research on idioms in NMT is limited
and obstructed by the absence of automatic methods for quantifying these
errors. In this work, first, we propose a novel metric for automatically
measuring the frequency of literal translation errors without human
involvement. Equipped with this metric, we present controlled translation
experiments with models trained in different conditions (with/without the
test-set idioms) and across a wide range of (global and targeted) metrics and
test sets. We explore the role of monolingual pretraining and find that it
yields substantial targeted improvements, even without observing any
translation examples of the test-set idioms. In our analysis, we probe the role
of idiom context. We find that the randomly initialized models are more local

using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM
performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics

versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at
untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs,
suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted
by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest
zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also
highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous
zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or

important roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to
co-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the
hyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one
responsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the
control of the robot.
  The key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it
does not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate
processes. Similar to nature, our method derives both the ""brain"" and the
""body"" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our
approach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of
processes during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the
search space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the
genome affects ""brain"" and the ""body"" at the same time.
  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into
consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the
similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very
different bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots
with different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they
won't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.
  We evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the
search space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process
converge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.

language classifiers against more crafty adversarial attacks that leverage
greedy- and attention-based word selection and context-aware embeddings for

effect by blurring out off-focus foreground occlusions while recovering
in-focus occluded scenes from multi-view images, its performance is often

on the asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range

refocused by a Refocus-Net module to align in-focus events while scattering out

learning machine interacting with a human participant in a virtual reality

knowledge-driven ones. Subsequently, we highlight the necessity of creating
semantic representations of data that satisfy the key properties of minimalism,
generalizability, and efficiency so as to do more with less. We then explain

models (LMs) with canonical utterance for few-shot semantic parsing. The
canonical utterance is often lengthy and complex due to the compositional
structure of formal languages. Learning to generate such canonical utterance
requires significant amount of data to reach high performance. Fine-tuning with
only few-shot samples, the LMs can easily forget pretrained knowledge, overfit
spurious biases, and suffer from compositionally out-of-distribution
generalization errors. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel few-shot
semantic parsing method -- SeqZero. SeqZero decomposes the problem into a
sequence of sub-problems, which correspond to the sub-clauses of the formal
language. Based on the decomposition, the LMs only need to generate short
answers using prompts for predicting sub-clauses. Thus, SeqZero avoids
generating a long canonical utterance at once. Moreover, SeqZero employs not
only a few-shot model but also a zero-shot model to alleviate the overfitting.
In particular, SeqZero brings out the merits from both models via ensemble
equipped with our proposed constrained rescaling. SeqZero achieves SOTA

Thereby, feature selection is a critical process in developing deep
learning-based recommender systems. Most existing deep recommender systems,
however, focus on designing sophisticated neural networks, while neglecting the
feature selection process. Typically, they just feed all possible features into
their proposed deep architectures, or select important features manually by
human experts. The former leads to non-trivial embedding parameters and extra
inference time, while the latter requires plenty of expert knowledge and human
labor effort. In this work, we propose an AutoML framework that can adaptively
select the essential feature fields in an automatic manner. Specifically, we
first design a differentiable controller network, which is capable of
automatically adjusting the probability of selecting a particular feature
field; then, only selected feature fields are utilized to retrain the deep

INR layers that are closer to the output play more critical roles in fitting

achieve impressive performance in highly complex, but largely static problems.
In contrast, biological learning seems to value efficiency of adaptation to a
constantly-changing world. Here we build on a recently-proposed neuronal
learning rule that assumes each neuron can optimize its energy balance by
predicting its own future activity. That assumption leads to a neuronal
learning rule that uses presynaptic input to modulate prediction error. We
argue that an analogous RL rule would use action probability to modulate reward
prediction error. This modulation makes the agent more sensitive to negative
experiences, and more careful in forming preferences. We embed the proposed
rule in both tabular and deep-Q-network RL algorithms, and find that it
outperforms conventional algorithms in simple, but highly-dynamic tasks. We
suggest that the new rule encapsulates a core principle of biological
intelligence; an important component for allowing algorithms to adapt to change

unclear whether a saliency model trained with weakly-supervised data (e.g.,

designing effective sequential encoders, fusing side information, and mining

Identifying informative negatives is challenging because informative negative

variability, a lack of sketch training data with corresponding ground truth 3D

synthesizing vector graphics training data underpins our integrated

the probability of an event occuring, it is therefore possible to determine the
surprisal associated with English sentences. The issues and pull requests of
software repository issue trackers give insight into the development process
and likely contain the surprising events of this process.
  Objective. Prior works have identified that unusual events in software
repositories are of interest to developers, and use simple code metrics-based
methods for detecting them. In this study we will propose a new method for
unusual event detection in software repositories using surprisal. With the
ability to find surprising issues and pull requests, we intend to further
analyse them to determine if they actually hold importance in a repository, or
if they pose a significant challenge to address. If it is possible to find bad
surprises early, or before they cause additional troubles, it is plausible that
effort, cost and time will be saved as a result.
  Method. After extracting the issues and pull requests from 5000 of the most
popular software repositories on GitHub, we will train a language model to
represent these issues. We will measure their perceived importance in the
repository, measure their resolution difficulty using several analogues,
measure the surprisal of each, and finally generate inferential statistics to

analysis further reveal stereotypical portrayals of both male and female

Previous methods sequentially encode features with a specified order. They
first encode the emotion and cause features for clause extraction and then
combine them for pair extraction. This lead to an imbalance in inter-task
feature interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with
the former. To address this issue, we propose a novel Pair-Based Joint Encoding
(PBJE) network, which generates pairs and clauses features simultaneously in a
joint feature encoding manner to model the causal relationship in clauses. PBJE
can balance the information flow among emotion clauses, cause clauses and
pairs. From a multi-relational perspective, we construct a heterogeneous

already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources
required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The
main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to
update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To
derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we
employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential
equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent
guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks
during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency
of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical

tiny decoders which maps them differently to the original input space. By
combining different codes and decoders interchangeably, we can dramatically
increase the number of synthetic examples with essentially the same parameter
count, because the latent space is much lower dimensional and since we can
assume as many decoders as necessary to capture different styles represented in
the dataset with negligible cost. Such knowledge factorization allows efficient
sharing of information between synthetic examples in a systematic way,
providing far better trade-off between compression ratio and quality of the

SLU (E2E SLU) based on Deep Neural Networks has gained momentum since it
benefits from the joint optimization of the ASR and the NLU parts, hence
limiting the cascade of error effect of the pipeline architecture. However,
little is known about the actual linguistic properties used by E2E models to
predict concepts and intents from speech input. In this paper, we present a
study identifying the signal features and other linguistic properties used by
an E2E model to perform the SLU task. The study is carried out in the
application domain of a smart home that has to handle non-English (here French)

always require a perfect ASR capability. Furthermore, the results show the
superior capabilities of the E2E model in handling background noise and
syntactic variation compared to the pipeline model. Finally, a finer-grained
